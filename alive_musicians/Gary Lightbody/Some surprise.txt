Your lips come as some surprise
That they would want to come and meet mine
They never taste like the last time
Your lips come as some surprise!
I was always a special child
Circuit boards for my insides
All I dreamed of was flying high
So your lips came as some surprise
Your lips come as some surprise
That they would want to come and meet mine
They never taste like the last time
Your lips come as some surprise!
I was never one of the boys
Throwing shapes and power ploys
In your arms warmth I did find
In your seat I did decline
Your lips come as some surprise
That they would want to come and meet mine
They never taste like the last time
Your lips come as some surprise!
Now that we've sat for a while
You've shown me yours and I've shown you mine
Even after all this time
Your lips come as some surprise
Your lips come as some surprise
That they would want to come and meet mine
They never taste like the last time
Your lips come as some surprise!
Your lips come as some surprise!
Your lips come as some surprise!
