Yeah

Clearing off a table in my mind was set for two
Acting like it's nothing but i'm feeling like a fool
And something's gotta break before another one brings me down
They bring me down
Next one had me trusting every word I thought was true
How could you keep lying as she's lying next to you
And something's gotta break before another one brings me down
They bring me down

But what if there's something that I keep missing
What if there's someone that I can't lose
Nights when I'm crying, will he listen
Isn't there anybody? Anybody?
What if there's someone that makes me happy
Someone that I already knew
What if, what it, what if that anybody?
Anybody's you?
Any, anybody's you?
Yeah

Chasing after trouble with the one I wouldn't keep
One of many wasting time falling at his feet
Feels good going up then it crashes hard when it brings me down
They bring me down
I'm getting tired, tired, of looking everywhere for somebody like you
I'm just tired, tired, and it brings me down
They bring me down

But what if there's something that I keep missing
What if there's someone that I can't lose
Nights when I'm crying, will he listen
Isn't there anybody? Anybody?
What if there's someone that makes me happy
Someone that I already knew
What if, what it, what if that anybody?
Anybody's you?
Any, anybody's you?
Yeah
Anybody's you
Someone to listen
Someone to make me happy
Someone who loves me
What if that anybody's you
Someone to listen
Someone to make me happy
Someone who loves me
What if that anybody is you

What if there's something that I keep missing
What if there's someone that I can't lose
Night when I'm crying, will he listen
Isn't there anybody? Anybody?
What if there's someone that makes me happy
Someone that I already knew
What if, what it, what if that anybody?
Oh, Anybody's you?
Any, anybody's you?
Yeah
Any, anybody's you
Any, anybody's you
Any, anybody's you
