You walked into the room like king of the world
Like you could have your pick of all of the girls (true)
There's rumors you've been looking all over town (true)
Tryin' to hook someone for jamming around

I got news for you, this time it is over
Boy, I see right through
We are going nowhere
I'd rather starve than eat your pretty little lies
Oh, oh, oh

This is my, absolutely final
I am really leaving goodbye
Every time, I take you back, you do me over goodbye
Pack your bag, get in a cab and don't look back, it's goodbye
Absolutely final, I am really leaving goodbye

I spelled it out, do you get it now?
I spelled it out, do you get it now?
I spelled it out, do you get it now?
Haha ho, I'm telling you
At first, you showered me with all your attention (yeah)
Tryin' to do some things I can't even mention (true)
You wanna have your way and still kiss the girl (so true)
But, you are living in a dream world

I got news for you, this time it is over (ooh-ooh)
Boy, I see right through
We are going nowhere
I'd rather starve than eat your pretty little lies
Oh, oh, oh

This is my, absolutely final
I am really leaving goodbye
Every time, I take you back, you do me over goodbye
Pack your bag, get in a cab and don't look back, it's goodbye
Absolutely final, I am really leaving goodbye

These games, that you're playing
Are played, and I'm saying
No, use in wasting
That clever little mouth
You can't, kid a kidder
The sweet taste is bitter
Boy, I found you out

I got news for you, this time it is over (ooh-ooh)
Boy, I see right through
We are going nowhere
I'd rather starve than eat your pretty little lies
Oh, oh, oh

This is my, absolutely final
I am really leaving goodbye
Every time, I take you back, you do me over goodbye
Pack your bag, get in a cab and don't look back, it's goodbye
Absolutely final, I am really leaving goodbye

Read my lips
