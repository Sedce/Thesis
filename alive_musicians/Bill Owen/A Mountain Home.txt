Here I am dear
I'm on this mountain
A time of falling snow
Nice and easy
My mind's at peace
I don't ever want
To go back home
To go back home
Looking down here
From this mountain
I can see a wilderness
Your blood and all, you
You flow like rivers
I don't ever want
To go back home
To go back home
I've been thinking
To take you away with me
We could make a mountain home
Light the fire
Watch the world go and then become
This is home
This is home
