I'm on the floor honey
And broken glass and I
I dont like the view anymore
I find my feet returning
To pick and dreams and I
Know I can't do it all alone
I take the reins and I
Make the sunflower
A glass ago of a green ferar
I can't dream without you here
Cause my dream is you
You take my hand and walk away
To a better place
A better place
You see that time honey
Were laughin now but I
I seen it was an awful year
Runnin' round and I
Up and down and I
I was runnin till yesterday
I stopped to turn and listen
A loving dream it had me
Turn around
I can't dream without you here
Cause my dream is you
You take my hand and walk away
To a better place
A better place
Mmmmm
I can't dream without you here
Cause my dream is you
You take my hand and walk away
To a better place
A better place
