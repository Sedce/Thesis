("We're on.")
("That's a nice way to start, Johnny.")

Are you such a dreamer
To put the world to rights?
I'll stay home forever
Where two and two always makes a five

I'll lay down the tracks
Sandbag and hide
January has April showers
And two and two always makes a five

It's the devil's way now
There is no way out
You can scream and you can shout
It is too late now

Because
You have not been
Paying attention
Paying attention
Paying attention
Paying attention
You have not been
Paying attention
Paying attention
Paying attention
Paying attention
You have not been
Paying attention
Paying attention
Paying attention
Paying attention
You have not been
Paying attention
Paying attention
Paying attention
Paying attention

I try to sing along
But the music's all wrong
Cause I'm not, cause I'm not
I swat em like flies but
Like flies the buggers
Keep coming back, God
But I'm not, but I'm not
Oh, hail to the thief
Oh, hail to the thief
But I'm not, but I'm not
But I'm not, but I'm not
Don't question my authority or put me in a box
Cause I'm not, cause I'm not
Oh, go and tell the king, that the sky is falling in
But it's not, but it's not, but it's not
Maybe not, maybe not
