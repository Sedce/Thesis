You know, I just can't help it
A bad habbit I'm hooked he's got me I can't break it
One hit, can't quit, last sip, thats it
Quick fix, don't fall, withdraw
Naw!

Tryin' not to stumble
Slurrin words that mumble sayin
Baby...baby..Baby
Your poisons got me up and down, head spinnin round and round
I'm goin crazy, crazy, take me
Boy you got that love, I just can't get enough
Thats why, I'm so addicted

(Missy Eliott)
Got my lights in my trunk
Let it glow, feel the bass
Let it bump, let it bump
Down here in the A
We can kick it wit my girls
We can kick it wit the boys
If you feel me make some noise
Hit It

(Ciara)
