Gonna drift on down to the county town
The place where I was born
Gonna ask my childhood sweetheart
To tell me how I've done
I always used to worry a lot
About what I'd become
I guess it's really only her
Who will know if I have won
There's a reunion at the Grange County Secondary School
Where there's a bunch of us
Thrown together at a formative age
We couldn't pass our 11+
Strange lesson at the age of eleven
To find that life ain't chance
And if at first you don't succeed
You've already been a failure once
From Amersham, to Missenden, to Wendover, to the Vale of Aylesbury
That's me, heading down the 413
From Amersham, to Missenden, to Wendover, to the Vale of Aylesbury
That's me, heading down the 413
I'm gonna wander into the Bell Hotel
At the bottom of the market square
I'll ask the girl behind the bar
If they still do bands in there
I'll tell her I've written something new
Can I get my guitar
There might be someone who remembers me
From 1974
The Bucks Herald is the local paper
Serving the community
I'm gonna ask the editor
If they'll do a piece on me
I can say that I've had some new photos done
And I'm sure I've got some archive stuff
I guess they will do something
If a hit gets high enough
From Amersham, to Missenden, to Wendover, to the Vale of Aylesbury
That's me, heading down the 413
From Amersham, to Missenden, to Wendover, to the Vale of Aylesbury
That's me, heading down the 413
