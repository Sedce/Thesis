Okay, let's make this the big one for Otway
Look out, baby, look out, pet
Here's the kid
Who's gonna get the blues
When you go away
I'm on fire 'cause I'm in love
With a girl who's not the girl she was
When I was out with her
I saw you in the garden minute
You looked so debonair
Beware of the flowers
Because I'm sure they're gonna get you
Yeah
I won't try to say goodbye
Maybe I'll just kick myself inside
I really wanted to go home
You might say that today
Was the very last time you walked this way
You'll tell him on your own
Well, I'd tell him where to go to, baby
But you know I wouldn't dare
Beware of the flowers
Because I'm sure they're gonna get you
Yeah
Disagree, disapprove
Baby, they all said that it was me
Who went out in the nude
How can you be so sure
Baby, when the love shines its pure
It's a light thine shines on us
Well, I know someone who loves you, baby
And I know he really cares
Beware of the flowers
Because I'm sure they're gonna get you
Yeah
