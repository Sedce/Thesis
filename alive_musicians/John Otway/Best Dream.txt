I think it must be the best dream I've ever had
To be with you on such a starry night it can't be surpassed
And after all the other kids my friends have dated with
By far baby, the best of all is you
Ain't there no-one else around to love me when I'm down
And not treat me like a fool and wouldn't be so cruel to leave me?
And I think it was almost the dream of dreams
To be with you so high and so finally
I'll forget the other girls that I have in my dreams
'cause by far baby, the best of all is you
Ain't there no-one else around to love me when I'm down
And not treat me like a fool and wouldn't be so cruel to leave me?
