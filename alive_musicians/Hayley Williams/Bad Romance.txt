I want your love, I want your disease
I want you, open mouthed and on your knees
I want your love, love love love, I want your love
I want your drama, the touch of your hand
I want you leather chocked and cuffed in the head
I want your love, love love love, I want your love
I want your loving and I want your revenge
You and me could write bad romance
I want your loving, all your love is revenge
You and me could write a bad romance

I want your horror, I want your resign
I make you beg as long as you're mine
I want your love, love love love, I want your love
I want your psycho, your vertigo kiss
I want you in my bed, I'll make you sick
I want your love, love love love
I want your loving and I want your revenge
You and me could write a bad romance
I want your loving, all your love is revenge
You and me could write a bad romance

No no
I want your loving and I want your revenge
You and me could write a bad romance
I want your loving, all you love is revenge
You and me could write a bad romance
