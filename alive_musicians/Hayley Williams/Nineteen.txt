I felt you in my legs before I ever met you
And when you laid beside me for the first time, I told you
I feel you in my heart and I don't even know you

Now we're saying bye
Bye, bye
Now we're saying bye
Bye, bye

I was nineteen
Call me
I was nineteen
Call me

I felt you in my life before I ever thought to
Feel the need to lay down beside you and tell you
That I feel you in my heart and I don't even know you

And now we're saying bye
Bye, bye
Now we're saying bye
Bye, bye

I was nineteen
Calling
I was nineteen
Calling

Flew home, back to where we met
Stayed inside, I was so upset
Cooked up a plan, it was good except I was all alone
You were all I had
Love you
You were all mine
Love me
I was yours right?
Love you
You were all mine
Love me
I was yours right?
I was yours right?

I was nineteen
Call me
I was nineteen
Could you blame me?
Could you blame me?

I was nineteen
Calling
I was nineteen
Calling
