Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Are we all we are?
Are we all we are?
Cut to now, holy wow
When did everything become
Such a hell of a mess?
Maybe now, maybe now
Can somebody come and
Take this off my chest?
I know you think it's not your problem
I know you think that God'll solve them
But if your shit is not together
It'll never be, you and me, plant the seed
Open up and let it be
We are the people that you'll
Never get the best of
Not forget the rest of, rest of
We've had our fill, we've had enough
We've had it up to here
Are we all we are?
Are we all we are?
We are the people that you'll
Never get the best of
Not forget the rest of, rest of
Just sing it loud
Until the kids will sing it right back
Are we all we are?
Are we all we are?
Are we all we are?
Are we all we are?
Seven seconds, seven seconds
That is all the time you got
To make your point
My attention, my attention's
Like an infant trying to crawl
Around this joint
I know we're better than the masses
But we're all following our asses
And if our shit is not together
It'll never be, you and me, plant the seed
Open and let it be
We are the people that you'll
Never get the best of
Not forget the rest of, rest of
We've had our fill, we've had enough
We've had it up to here
Are we all we are?
Are we all we are?
We are the people that you'll
Never get the best of
Not forget the rest of, rest of
Just sing it loud
Until the kids will sing it right back
Are we all we are?
Are we all we are?
Four, that's how many years it took me
To get through the lesson
That I had to do it all on my own
Three, that's how many Hail Mary's
They would pray for me
Thinking I was gonna end up all alone
Two, for second chances
That you've given me, can it be?
Lucky me, lucky me, now let's go
One, is what we are, is what we are
Are we all we are?
Are we all we are?
We are the people that you'll
Never get the best of
Not forget the rest of, rest of
We've had our fill, we've had enough
We've had it up to here
Are we all we are?
Are we all we are?
We are the people that you'll
Never get the best of
Not forget the rest of, rest of
Just sing it loud
Until the kids will sing it right back
Are we all we are?
Are we all we are?
We are the people that you'll
Never get the best of
Not forget the rest of, rest of
We've had our fill, we've had enough
We've had it up to here
Are we all we are?
Are we all we are?
We are the people that you'll
Never get the best of
Not forget the rest of, rest of
Cut to the future, sing it loud
And take the power back
Are we all we are?
Are we all we are?
