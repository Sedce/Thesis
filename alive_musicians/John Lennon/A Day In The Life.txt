I read the news today, oh, boy
About a lucky man whos made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well, I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights have changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
Theyd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the house of lords
I saw a film today, oh, boy
The english army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book
Id love to turn you on
Woke up, fell out of bad
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up, I noticed I was late
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream
I saw the news today, oh, boy
Four-thousand holes in blackburn, lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the albert hall
Id love to turn you on
