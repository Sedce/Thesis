Because you know I'm all about that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all about that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all about that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all about that bass, 'bout that bass
[chorus]
I'm all about that, all about that bass
I'm all about that, all about that bass
I'm all about that bass, no treble
We gon' take it to a whole 'nother level, bass
We know that shit ain't real, we know that shit ain't real
We know that shit ain't real, we know it's photoshopped
We know that shit ain't real, we know that shit ain't real
We know that shit ain't real, we know it's
