[chorus]
Said one, two, three, four, five
I just wanna, I just wanna spend the night
With you love
Oh you, love
Said one, two, three, four, five
I just wanna, I just wanna spend the night
With you love
Oh you love
[verse]
Girl don't worry 'bout nothing
Nothing, nothing, nothing
Oh, when you used to worry about the little things
Girl don't worry 'bout nothing
Nothing, nothing, nothing
Babe, I'll take control
