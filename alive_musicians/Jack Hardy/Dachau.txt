Only a stone's throw
That close to knowing
Over the stone wall
That close to the town
That place you can't go
So hard to travel
Picked up a small stone
Could not put it down
Take all of my money
Take all of my clothing
Take all of my labor
I still do not know
I still cannot feel it
Or make it a real thing
How one to another
Could ever be so
And I'm not a tailor
And I'm not a gypsy
Nor a professor
With my name on my face
A freedom fighter
A left wing conspirer
Who traveled the boxcars
To this lonely place
I'm just a tourist
I take a memento
Or maybe a relic
Though only a stone
Like East Europeans
Posing for photos
In front of the ovens
A video show
I wanted to feel it
That final solution
I want it to touch me
To take me inside
I want it to hold me
I want it to scold me
Make me part of the blame
Why so many died
But only foundations
Are left of the stone wall
Almost at closing
With time running out
I walked in the cold rain
Clutching a cold stone
The gate was still open
For us to walk out
