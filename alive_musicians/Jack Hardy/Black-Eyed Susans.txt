Black eyed susans by the road
In all those places time forgot
Run and run from what we know
Sometimes easy, sometimes not
Youth is but a flowered field
Daisies and forget-me-nots
All of this a letter sealed
Reminding us what we forgot
Old enough to touch a heart
Young enough to not reply
To stand upon the kitchen stool
And kiss your mother goodbye
Open to the morning sun
Reveal the beauty 'neath the cloud
Only nature having fun
All for crying out loud
The wind upon the clouds on high
The wind upon the brittle chaff
Birds on the electric wire
To see who will be last to laugh
All these colors on display
They all go so well with you
All so well in god's bouquet
All except for black and blue
