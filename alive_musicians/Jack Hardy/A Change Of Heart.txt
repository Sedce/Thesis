And so I told you right from the start
I cannot hold you to a change of heart
There are things I could never say
Too young, too old to try to change our ways
I'm not the person I care to be
Always waiting on bended knee
For a change of heart
How well we travel these outer parts
Yet cannot fathom these depths of dark
And I would never be alone today
If the piper didn't ask his pay
And if that piping didn't drive the dance
Always waiting for the chance
For a change of heart
There's only one way to be alone
And you must learn this on your own
It's not the reason that brings you home
It's not the season for what we've sown
And that flowering I could not share
Cold earth and sunlight you would not dare
For a change of heart
And 'round this old house the wind it whines
With a knocking keeping time
It's not the first time, it's not the last
It's not that springtime covers up the past
And I told you right from the start
Sometimes forever just falls apart
For a change of heart
