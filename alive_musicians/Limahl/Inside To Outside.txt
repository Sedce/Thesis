Is it your alluring way
Could you always drown the fire?
Keep a check on all you feel
Keep a hold on all your desire
But I feel there's something new and it's lying in your eyes
There's a shudder running through you
Now I realize
Inside turning to outside
The feeling you can't hide is touching a high-light
In your eyes
Inside turning to outside
It's gonna be alright
It's running a high for you and I
Like a shadow of yourself
Like a spirit in the air
Looking desperately for help
You've been looking everywhere
My heart is beating fast
Blue eyes are locked on mine
A vision flashes past
Moving me in time
Inside turning to outside
.. 
And we can live in a beautiful world
Hide away under peaceful skies
We can sunrive on time and a word
Feel the nights passing by
Inside to outside - inside to outside - inside to outside
Inside turning to outside
.. 
Inside turning to outside
.. 
Inside turning to outside
..
