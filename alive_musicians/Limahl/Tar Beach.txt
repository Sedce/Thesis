Living in the city can be tough on you
Got to get away once in a while
Hope I'll see you when the day is through
Ready for a change of style
So in the heat don't be shy -
Use your imagination
Now it's complete
Sunshine and heat
Surround you on tar beach
I will meet you there
On tar beach
Where you can lose
Those city blues
I will meet you there
On tar beach
Sunshine and heat
Surround you on tar beach
.. 
So many situations
From day to day
The circle is turning so fast
And who is loving who need I say
Tell me how long will it last
So uncertain what the future holds
We never know what to expect
Searching for that person we are told
Love will be it's effect
We hold the key to control our own destination
Turn it and you'll see
Sunshine and heat surround you on tar beach
.. 
Sunshine and heat surround you on tar beach
.. 
Sunshine and heat surround you on tar beach
I will meet you there
