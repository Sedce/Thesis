I feel a presence in the air of something special
Something rare
Love in your eyes is the reason why
Holding the secret's a certain prize
Love in your eyes is the flame
That makes me feel so warm inside
Were silent wishes to be heard
It would express that single word
Love in youx eyes is the reason why . . 
It suddenly takes you by the hand
And leads you through the promised land
Is this really happening to me and you?
A thousand words could not describe
This precious way I feel alive
Love in your eyes is the reason why . . 
Build your love on a strong foundation
And you will feel the sweet sensation -
And you will feel the sweet sensation -
And you will feel the sweet sensation -
And you wiU. feel the sweet sensation
