[verse]
When love’s a battle
And life’s a war
When I just can’t go on fighting anymore
When I’m surrounded
And they’re closing in
When I feel the bullets graze against my skin

This world’s a warzone
And I’ve got a shield
And I won’t surrender
Cause your love feels
[chorus]
Like an army of angels
Like an army of angels
Like an army of angels
Like an army of angels
[verse]
If hate is poison then loves the cure
And it’s you that drives the demons from my door
When they got me cornered
Close to giving in
Oh I feel you round me like a second skin
[chorus]
This world’s a warzone
And I’ve got a shield
And I won’t surrender
Cause your love feels
Like an army of angels
Like an army of angels
Like an army of angels
Like an army of angels, angels, angels, angels
