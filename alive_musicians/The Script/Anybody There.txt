[verse]
My head is saying no
But my heart keeps giving in
So hard to let it go
When it's there under my skin

Well, if this is the face of a sinner
And if heaven is only for winners
Well, I don't care
Cause I won't know anybody there

Thought that I'd let it slide
But it's me that's slipping in
Thought that I'd go for a ride
Before this crash I'm dying in
[chorus]
Well, if I'm judged on the life I've been living
And if heaven is not so forgiving
Well, I don't care
Cause I won't know anybody there (x2)
