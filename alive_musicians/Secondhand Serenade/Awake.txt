[verse]
With every appearance by you
Blinding my eyes
I can hardly remember
The last time I felt like I do
You're an angel disguised
(Verse 2)
And you're lying real still
But your heartbeat is fast just like mine
And the movie's long over
That's three that have passed, one more's fine
(Chorus)
Will you stay awake for me?
I don't wanna miss anything
I don't wanna miss anything
I will share the air I breath
I'll give you my heart on a string
I just don't wanna miss anything
(Verse 3)
Im trying real hard not to shake
Im biting my tongue
But im feeling alive
And with every breath that I take
I feel like I've won
You're my key to survival
(Verse 4)
And if its a hero you want
I can save you. Just stay here
Your whispers are priceless
Your presence is dear
So please stay here
(Chorus)
Will you stay awake for me?
I don't wanna miss anything
I don't wanna miss anything
I will share the air I breathe
I'll give you my heart on a string
I just don't wanna miss anything
(Verse 5)
Say my name. I just want to hear you
Say my name. So I know its true
You're changing me. You're changing me
You showed me how to live
So just say. So just say
(Verse 6)
That you'll stay awake for me
I don't wanna miss anything
I don't wanna miss anything
I will share the air I breathe
I'll give you my heart on a string
I just don't wanna miss anything
