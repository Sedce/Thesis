I've been around the world, seen a lot, seen a little
But everything is better when it's just plain simple
Always sleeping in, skipping out monday night
Counting on my tips, saving up for whatever
Make a little move on my best friend's sister
Ain't nobody wrong, everybody gonna feel alright
And talk about a good time
Living life like it's a dare
Getting high with time to spare
Look how everything has changed
Take me back to the old days
Every day a brand new start
Dressed up in the same old smile
I am proud of my ways
Take me back to the old days
Back to the old days
I had an old guitar, had a band, had some people
Strumming out, playing out, waking up the neighbors
Didn't have a lot but it's all I would ever need
Camel on the back, it was fun, I was living
Nothing ever lasts cause the world keeps living
Holding onto the way it used to be, it was always easy
Living life like it's a dare
Getting high with time to spare
Look how everything has changed
Take me back to the old days
Every day a brand new start
Dressed up in the same old smile
I am proud of my ways
Take me back to the old days
I think we'll take a dare for and tell myself the glass is full
I turn off the phone and get on with all the worries of today
We'll be okay
Back to the old days
Take me back to the old days
Living life like it's a dare
Getting high with time to spare
Look how everything has changed
Take me back to the old days
Every day a brand new start
Dressed up in the same old smile
I am proud of my ways
Take me back to the old days
