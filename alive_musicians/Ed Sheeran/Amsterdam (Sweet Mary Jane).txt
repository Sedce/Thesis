[verse]
I woke up early looking out my window
At the Amsterdam sky
Oh baby I was high last night
Café clouds and red lights
When I gotcha in mind
You slowed down time
Oh baby I was out of my mind
Sing a song cover and hold me tight

[chorus]
Cause everyday that I'm breathing I think you are the one
I love the way that your sweet words just roll off of my tongue
Feel the flame of your wisdom and fill up my lungs
Sweet Mary Jane won’t you sing me another song
