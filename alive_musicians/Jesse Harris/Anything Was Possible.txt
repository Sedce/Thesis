When I was lost in the silence
In the darkness on the road
You reached out and you touched me
Where I was walking all alone
With such a gentle pull
You told me not to worry
And though my hands were full
Anything was possible
I wouldn’t say you forgave me
Cause you didn’t know me from before
And I would’t say that you saved me
But you kept me walking through that door
With such a gentle pull
You told me not to worry
And though my hands were full
Anything was possible
Anything was possible
Anything was possible
