Come on back
Don't be long
Come on back
Come on
You were right
I was wrong
Come on back
Come on home
I watched you go
Around the bend
But I know
It's not the end
Come on back
Don't be long
Come on back
Come on home
You're flying away
Through the clouds
You're flying away
From me now
Come on back
Don't be long
Come on back
Come on home
