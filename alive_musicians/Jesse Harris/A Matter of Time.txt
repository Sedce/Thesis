I had no way to see your face
I could only dance in place
It was so far away
It was so far away
Though the stars were unaligned
I could paint your picture in my mind
It was just a matter of time
By now I know you’re no one’s fool
But break any unspoken rule
There’d be no guilt to pay
There’d be no guilt to pay
So I walk a narrow line
At the edge of every fleeting crime
It’s just a matter of time
It’s just a matter of time
A matter of time
A matter of time
A matter of time
A matter of time
So I watch the days go by
Till the flying particles collide
It’s just a matter of time
It’s just a matter of time
It’s just a matter of time
It’s just a matter of time
