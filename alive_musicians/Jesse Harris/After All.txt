Weren't you so strong that you played with fire
And you didn't get burned by your own desire?
But after all you've said and done
You had to fall like everyone, like everyone
Isn't it so hard when you're going down
And to really believe you'll turn it back around?
And after all you've said and done
You had to fall like everyone, like everyone
The blazing sun looks you in the eye
When you crash down through the sky
And after all you've said and done
You had to fall like everyone, like everyone
