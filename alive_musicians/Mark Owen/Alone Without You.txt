I listened to your album
And I watched your favourite film
Hey hey hey
I missed you today
I read those early letters
That were filled with early dreams
Some of them materialised, others never seen
We used to watch the world walking by

The truth is you're not here
Here I am, I'm screwed up again
No matter what
Which way I turn
How am I feeling?
Slowly bleeding here for you
I'm spending time with hope
And I don't know why it is
It's just the way it is

What am I to say?
What am I to do?
What am I alone without you?
What am I to say?
What am I to do?
What am I alone without you!

I made your favourite dinner
And I wore the shirt you love
Hey hey hey
Just in case you came
Friends still ask about you
And I say that you're just fine
And have you seen the world walking by?

The truth is you're not here
Here I am, I'm screwed up again
No matter what
Which way I turn
How am I feeling?
Slowly bleeding here for you
I'm spending time with hope
And I don't know why it is
It's just the way it is

What am I to say?
What am I to do?
What am I alone without you?
What am I to say?
What am I to do?
What am I alone without you?

The truth is you're not here
And I'm screwed up again
And I don't know the reason why
I don't know why it is
And did I ever say
That I just need your love
And I want you back again
I want you back again
You said that this isn't yet our time
So give me time
To get you back again

What am I to say?
What am I to do?
What am I alone without you?
What am I to say?
What am I to do?
What am I alone without you?
It's for you that I fall out of bed in the morning
Still checking the mail as I'm leaving
I sit in the car without driving
I want you back again
What am I to say?
What am I to do?
What am I alone without you?
What am I to say?
What am I to do?
What am I alone without you?
