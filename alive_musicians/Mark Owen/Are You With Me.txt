Taking a walk
Through the valley of a roadside
Taking a walk through the valley of a roadside
On a sunny afternoon
Smoking a smoke
Through the streets of poppyfield
Smoking a smoke through the streets of poppyfield
On a sunny afternoon

I'm travelling down a man made avenue
There's a stop sign
This time I'm going through

Are you with me on my journey
Are you with me in the search for the sunshine
On a sunny afternoon

Now I'm driving my car
Down the path of a hillside
Driving my car down the path of a hillside
On a sunny afternoon
Holding your hand
Down a lane made for lovers
Holding your hand down a lane made for lovers
On a sunny afternoon

I'm travelling down a man made avenue
There's a stop sign
This time I'm going through

Are you with me on my journey
Are you with me in my search for the sunshine
On a sunny afternoon

I'm travelling down a man made avenue
There's a stop sign
This time I'm going through

Are you with me on my journey
Are you with me in my search for the sunshine
On a sunny afternoon
Are you with me on my journey
Are you with me in my search for the sunshine, sunshine
On a sunny afternoon
Sunshine on a sunny afternoon
Sunshine on a sunny afternoon
Sunshine on a sunny afternoon
