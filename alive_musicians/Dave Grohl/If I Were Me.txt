Whisper all your secrets
Tell me all your lies
Screaming your confessions
Show me where you hide
Long your roots are lying
Deep with in the dirt
Love already dying
Long before its birth
If I were me I'd wait forever
What's your hurry, what's your hurry?
Never learned how to say never
What's your worry, what's your worry?
Once upon a time, the end
Could you hear me calling?
Did you hear me cry?
Do you feel me falling
Frozen in the light?
Space between the moment
Pause between the breaths
Sins between the sermons
Life between the death
If I were me I'd wait forever
What's your hurry, what's your hurry?
Never learned how to say never
What's your worry, what's your worry?
Once upon a time, the end
If I were me I'd wait forever
What's your hurry, what's your hurry?
Never learned how to say never
What's your worry, what's your worry?
Haunting me for all the bother
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry...
Once upon a time... The end
