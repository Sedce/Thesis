It's a beautiful day

It's a rather nice day

A day for a glorious wedding

A rehearsal my dear, to be perfectly clear

A rehearsal for a glorious wedding

Assuming nothing happens that we don't really know

That nothing unexpected interferes with the show

And that's why every thing
Every last little thing
Every single tiny microscopic little thing must go

According to plan

Our son will be married

According to plan

Our family carried

Elevated to the heights of society

To the costume balls

In the hallowed halls

Rubbing elbows with the finest

Having crumpets with Her Highness

We'll be there, we'll be seen
Having tea with the queen
We'll forget everything
That we've ever, ever been
(dialogue)

It's a terrible day

Now don't be that way

It's a terrible day for a wedding

It's a sad, sad state of affairs we're in

That has led to this ominous wedding

How could our family have come to this?

To marry off our daughter to the nouveau riche

They're so common

So coarse

Oh it couldn't be worse

Couldn't be worse? I'm afraid I disagree
They could be land-rich, bankrupt aristocracy
Without a penny to their name
Just like you, and me

Oh dear

And that's why everything
Every last little thing
Every single tiny microscopic little thing must go

According to plan

Our daughter will wed

According to plan

Our family led

From the depths of deepest poverty

To the noble realm

Of our ancestry

And who'd have guessed in a million years
That our daughter with a face

Of an otter in disgrace

Would provide our ticket to a rightful place

What if Victor and I don't...like each other?
As if that has anything to do with marrige. Do you suppose your father and I like each other?

Surely you must...a little...

Of course not!

Get those corsets laced properly...I can hear you speak without gasping
Marriage is a partnership. A little tit-for-tat
You'd think a lifetime watching us
(sung)
Might have taught her that
Might have taught her that

Everything must be perfect

Everything must be perfect

Everything must be perfect

Everything must be perfect perfect

That's why everything
Every last little thing
Every single tiny microscopic little thing must go
According to plan
