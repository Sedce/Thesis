I bought myself a new airmobile
I feel like a king behind the wheel
I got a powerful engine and a hideaway ranch
Push a button and hear her sing
You can't catch me
You can't catch me
If you get too close
Well i'm gone like a cool breeze
I found my baby last saturday night
Not a grey cloud shinning in sight
A great full moon shinning above
Cuddle up honey and be my love
You can't catch me
You can't catch me
If you get too close
Well i'm gone like a cool breeze
I had the radio tuned to rock n' roll
Heard the sound of the state patrol
Like a song on the radio i was going too fast
Gotta get on home before i run out of gas
You can't catch me
You can't catch me
If you get too close
Well i'm gone like a cool breeze
I bought myself a new airmobile
I feel like a king behind the wheel
I got a powerful engine and a hideaway ranch
Push a button and hear her sing
You can't catch me
You can't catch me
If you get too close
Well i'm gone like a cool breeze
