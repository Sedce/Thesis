[verse]
I probably shouldn't say this, but at times I get so scared
When I think about the previous relationship we've shared
It was awesome, but we lost it
It's not possible for me not to care
And now we're standing in the rain
But nothing's ever going to change until you hear, my dear
The 7 things I hate about you

The[chorus] 7 things I hate about you, oh, you
You're vain, your games, you're insecure
You love me, you like her
You make me laugh, you make me cry
I don't know which side to buy
Your friends, they're jerks
When you act like them, just know it hurts
I want to be with the one I know
And the 7th thing I hate the most that you do
You make me love you
[verse]
It's awkward and silent as I wait for you to say
But what I need to hear now is your sincere apology
And when you mean it, I'll believe it
If you text it, I'll delete it
Let's be clear
Oh, I'm not coming back
You're taking 7 steps here
[chorus]
The 7 things I hate about you
You're vain, your games, you're insecure
You love me, you like her
You make me laugh, you make me cry
I don't know which side to buy
Your friends, they're jerks
When you act like them, just know it hurts
I want to be with the one I know
And the 7th thing I hate the most that you do
You make me love you
[chorus]
The 7 things I like about you
Your hair, your eyes, your old Levi's
And when we kiss, I'm hypnotized
You make me laugh, you make me cry
But I guess that's both I'll have to buy
Your hand in mine
When we're intertwined everything's alright
I want to be with the one I know
And the 7th thing I like the most that you do
You make me love you
You do, oh
