[verse]
Baby, baby, are you listening?
Wondering where you've been all my life
I just started living
Oh baby, are you listening?
Oh
[chorus]
When you say you love me
Know I love you more
And when you say you need me
Know I need you more
Boy, I adore you
I adore you
[verse]
Baby, can you hear me
When I'm crying out for you?
I'm scared, oh, so scared
But when you're near me
I feel like I'm standing with an army
Of men armed with weapons
[chorus]
When you say you love me
Know I love you more
And when you say you need me
Know I need you more
Boy, I adore you
I adore you
[verse]
I love lying next to you
I could do this for eternity, you and me
We're meant to be in holy matrimony
God knew exactly what He was doing
When He led me to you
[chorus]
When you say you love me
Know I love you more
And when you say you need me
Know I need you more
Boy, I adore you
I adore you
