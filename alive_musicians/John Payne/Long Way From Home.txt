There's a black Siberian
Look a white guy in the sun
Miles away from where the quest begun
From the ice to the sand
Nations moved across the land
Ever since time designed the man
Someday to return
To the place of my birth
I'm a long way from home
But I know where I belong
It's a long way I know
But the heart will still carry me home
Firewater in the blood
Took away the livelihood
Giving thanks every single year
Who the hell
Owns this land?
Is it God or is it man?
But with blood we draw the line again
I want to return
To the place of my birth
I'm a long way from home
But I know where I belong
It's a long way I know
But the heart will still carry me home
I'm a long way from home
But I know where I belong
It's a long way I know
But the heart will still carry me home
