Tryna live my life any way I like it
Never let a simp' nigga mess up my eye lid
Something 'bout yo' eyes, they hit me by surprise, shit
Feelin' hella sprung, if you with it then you got it
I've been waitin' up, nothin' on but your chain now
Filling up the tub, what's the scent of the day now
Boy you can't resist it, boy you know you miss it
Can we find a way?

5 am I can't eat right, I can't sleep night
I can't do anything without you
I've been running from you all night and now it feel like
I can't do anything without you
Want you I want you babe
I want it baby
Want you I want you babe
Yeah I need it baby
Want you I want you babe
I want it baby

5 am and I want you baby
5 am and I want you baby

What you tryna play boy, you know I'm ready
I'm like a buffet, body's yours for the taking
Almost done for breakfast, tell me you gon' make it7Hungry, hungry boy, you'll be begging for the bacon
Practising my tricks, I got plenty
Throw one down right now if you'd let me
Tell me what you like
Ride if you ready, ride if you ready, ide if you ready


Cause it's 5am, 5am I can't eat right
I can't sleep right
Won't do anything without you
Can't do anything without you
