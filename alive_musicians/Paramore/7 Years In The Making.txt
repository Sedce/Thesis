I wanna go someplace
Where everybody wins
'Cause I've lost all my friends
Since they got brand new eyes
They don't look at me the same
It's anyone's guess where I went wrong
Now I'm the only one
Who's thinking back
Seven years ago
Seven years in the making
But we're always taking for granted
The hands that fed us full
Ten miles left to go
Time is healing nothing
Only a matter of numbers
That won't make us right
But I'm gonna make it through
Hey, hey, hey
I'm just tired
So don't push me
There's more than enough room
For a sad song or two
There was a beginning to the story
But I don't remember, I don't remember
There was a reason
Something we wanted
And I'm not backing down till I get it
Twenty years ago
Twenty years in the making
Well, I know the highway
Better than I know myself
In a few years I hope I settle in to
The big idea that I can't live for anyone else
But I'm gonna make it through
Hey, hey, hey
I'm just tired
So don't push me
There's more than enough room
For a sad song or two
I'm carrying bricks around my neck
I can't keep my head up
I can't see too far ahead
I can't keep my head up
It's like carrying bricks around my neck
To make you remember
It's like digging up the dead
'Cause you won't remember
How we got here
Why we are here?
When you finally decide it's worth the pain
I'm here
I never went anywhere
Growing older, I never thought that I
Would look back and not regret a thing
