21 times I, slowly cry
21 times I, slowly die
21 times I, wonder how
Want my baby, gone somehow - ooh
Down the road I'm goin', down so far
Down the road I go, I go so far alone
21 times I, sit and cry
21 times I, slowly die
21 dreams I, saw subside
Down the road and don't go cryin' - no
No no no no
Here I stand with my head in my hand
From my woman she's got another man
Saw my baby, she goin'
She gone some place but I don't know where
21 days I, stand and cried
21 times I slowly died
21 dreams I do
21 times I cried for you
Play it right
Look down the road and I
As far as I could see
Man got my woman
But the blues got me
Oh this ain't no livin', no game alone
Anythin' I done, said it was wrong
It's 21 times I, sit and cried
It's 21dreams it's
21 years that little girl left
21 times that she lied
