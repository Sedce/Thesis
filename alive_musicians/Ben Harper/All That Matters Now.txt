Its been a long hard day
And a long hard night
Been a hard year
Its been a hard life
But were together
And thats all that matters now
Well, the time has come
And the time has gone
Maybe I was born to be alone
But were together
And thats all that matters now
Been thrown by the wind
Drowned in the rain
I walked through some things
You dont want me to explain
But were together
And thats all that matters now
I can't get well
Theres no cure for life
Let me down easy
At least tonight
Now were together
And thats all that matters now
