I know you wanna leave me; I refuse to let you go
If I have to beg, plead for sympathy
I don't mind, 'cause it means that much to me
Ain't too proud to beg, sweet darlin
Please don't leave me, don't you go
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me, don't you go
Well I heard a quiet man, half a man, with no sense of pride
If I have to cry to keep ya I don't mind weepin'
If weepin' gonna keep ya by my side
Ain't too proud to beg, sweet darlin'
Please don't leave me, don't you go
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me, don't you go
If I have to sleep on your door step all night and day
Just to keep you from walkin' away
Let my friends laugh, for this I can stand
Just so long as I keep ya, yeah, yeah, I can
Ain't too proud to beg, sweet darlin'
Please don't leave me, don't you go
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me, don't you go
Ain't too proud to beg, sweet darlin'
Please don't leave me, don't you go
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me, don't you go
Well your love's so deep in the pit of my heart
Ev'ry day it grows more and more
I'm not ashamed to come and plead with you, baby
If pleadin' keeps you from walkin' out the door
Ain't too proud to beg, sweet darlin'
Please don't leave me, don't you go
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me, don't you go
Ain't too proud to beg, sweet darlin'
Please don't leave me, don't you go
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me, don't you go
