A house is a home, even when it's dark
Even when the grass is overgrown in the yard
Even when the dog is too old to bark
And when you're sittin' at the table tryin'  not to start
A house is a home, even when we've up and gone
Even when you're there alone
A house, a house, is a home
A house is a home, even when there's ghosts
Even when you gotta run from the ones you love the most
Screen doors broken, paints peeling from the wood
Locals whisper " When they gonna leave the neighborhood?"
A house is a home, even when we've up and gone
Even when you're there alone
A house, a house, is a home
A house is a home where the chores are never done
Where you spend your whole life running to and from
And if the life that you live is not the life you choose
Make your child a home and start anew
A house is a home, even when we've up and gone
Even when you're there alone
A house, a house,a house is a home
