When your heart is tired
And you’re feeling small
Like the words you’re saying
They don’t matter at all
I think you’re underestimated
Of the good in you
You need some more investigating
From a different view

Take a moment and just step back
Before you give yourself a heart attack
You’ve been too worried about what you lack
Time to breathe and get you on track

There is a fire that’s coming to light
A little spark to get through the night
Could be enough to see a new day
‘Cause a little goes, a little goes, a little goes a long way

Well, at the risk you’re taking
It could be a life in making
And the hope you’re hiding
It could be a bolt of lightning

Take a moment and just step back
Before you give yourself a heart attack
You’ve been too worried about what you lack
Time to breathe and get you on track
(You on track, you on track)

There is a fire that’s coming to light
A little spark to get through the night
Could be enough to see a new day
‘Cause a little goes, a little goes, a little goes a long way

Oh, it’s been a long road
To learn ‘bout the little things
Oh, it’s been a long road
To learn
And the hope you’re hiding (Oh, it’s been a long road)
It could be a bolt of lightning (To learn ‘bout the simple things)
At the risk you’re taking (Oh, it’s been a long road)
It could be a life in making (To learn ‘bout the simple things)
Oh, oh, oh no, yeah, yeah

There is a fire that’s coming to light
A little spark to get through the night
Could be enough to see a new day
‘Cause a little goes, it goes a long way
There is a fire that’s coming to light
A little spark to get through the night
Could be enough to see a new day
‘Cause a little goes, a little goes, a little goes a long way
Oh, it goes a long way
