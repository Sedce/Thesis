Watching the sky
Changing colors colliding tonight
Till I’m under a blanket of stars
Can’t help wondering where you are
Where you are

The darker it gets
The more I can see it

When you’re alone
And don’t know when the night will end
Just remember it’s never too long
So be strong
‘Cause there’s always a ray of hope

If there’s a way
A way to clear all these clouds
I’d show you how
There are always signs
Right above you
Made of lights, burning bright

And the darker it gets
The more you can see it

When you’re alone
And don’t know when the night will end
Just remember it’s never too long
So hold on
Cause there’s always a ray of hope


When you’re alone
And don’t know when the night will end
Just remember it’s never too long
So hold on
Cause there’s always a ray of
There’s always a ray of hope
