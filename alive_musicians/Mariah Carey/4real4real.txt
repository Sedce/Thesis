Sometimes you be blowin' my mind
If you were mine
I'd take my time with you but
On the low I'm shy though I front like I'm
So next level fly
With them other guys
Really I wanna reach out and just touch you
If you could only realize how much I like to
Come knock knockin' at your door
Give ol' girl the heave ho
And give a demonstration of what it's like

When it's 4real4real
100 percent 4real
Hotter than cable TV
Like something out of your dreams
It's 4real4real
Million percent the deal
So I'll just keep doing me
And eventually you'll see
I'm 4real4real


All my friends say I'm wasting my time on you
Trying to dissuade me with schemes
Wanna make you less than you seem
But I'm not that one, to listen to dumb
Chicks that want to be, where I'm gonna be
Really I wanna reach out and just touch you
If you could only realize how much I'd like to
Lay myself down next to you fall asleep
Watching cartoons
And wake you up with something good
Cause it's real



Check this out

Yo
This ain't for play, ain't for play
I been trynna figure it out
How to come at you off tay day
It's morning
And I wanna Shirley Murdock ya
Like as we lay, lay
Lately
But on the low I'm shy like MJ
I don't know what to say, say, say
But I know who I wanna do, do, do
I'm 4real, 4real, that's you, you, you
You ain't ever met nobody like me, me, me
Hotter than Comcast and satellite TV
Lemme demonstrate how it's supposed to be
Cause it's something you can't imagine
Like outta ya dreams
Obviously people gon' hate on me
They don't want me to date on ya
They don't want you with a paid woman
But they can't deny
That I'm a rider since day one
