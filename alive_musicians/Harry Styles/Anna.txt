Don’t know where you’re laying
Just know it’s not with me
Don’t know what I’d tell you if
I passed you on the street

I don’t want your sympathy, but you don’t know what you do to me
Oh! (Oh, Anna!)
Every time I see your face, there’s only so much I can take
Oh! (Oh, Anna!)

Don’t know how you taste when
There’s smoke in your perfume
Chew me up and spit me out
Nothing left to lose

I don’t want your sympathy, but you don’t know what you do to me
Oh! (Oh, Anna!)
Every time I see your face, there’s only so much I can take
Oh! (Oh, Anna!)


I don’t want your sympathy, but you don’t know what you do to me
Oh, Anna! (Oh, Anna!)
Every time I see your face, there’s only so much I can take
Oh, Anna! (Oh, Anna!)

Hope you never hear this
And know that it’s for you
I don’t know what I’d tell you if
You asked me for the truth

I don’t want your sympathy, but you’ll never know what you do to me
Oh, Anna! (Oh, Anna!)
Every time I see your face, there’s only so much I can take
Oh, Anna! (Oh, Anna!)

Well I guess it would be nice if I could touch your body
If I could touch your body
If I could touch your body
If I could touch your body

I don’t want your sympathy, but you’ll never know what you do to me
Oh, Anna! (Oh, Anna!)
Every time I see your face, there’s only so much I can take
Oh, Anna! (Oh, Anna!)
