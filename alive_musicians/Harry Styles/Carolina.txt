Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

She's got a family in Carolina (woo, oh yeah)
So far away, but she says I remind her of home (woo, oh yeah)
Feeling oh so far from home (woo, oh yeah)
She never saw herself as a West Coaster (woo, oh yeah)
Moved all the way 'cause her grandma told her: (woo, oh yeah)
"Townes, better swim before you drown" (woo, oh yeah)

She's a good girl (la la la la la la la la la la)
She's such a good girl (la la la la la la la la la la)
She's a good girl (la la la la la la la la la la)
She feels so good (woo, oh yeah)

She's got a book for every situation (situation)
Gets into parties without invitations (invitations)
How could you ever turn her down? (down, down, down, down)
There's not a drink that I think could sink her (sink her)
How would I tell her that she's all I think about? (think about)
Well, I guess she just found out

She's a good girl (la la la la la la la la la la)
She's such a good girl (la la la la la la la la la la)
She's a good girl (la la la la la la la la la la)
She feels so good (woo, oh yeah)
She feels so good (woo, oh yeah)

I met her once and wrote a song about her (woo, oh yeah)
I wanna scream, yeah
I wanna shout it out (woo, oh yeah)
And I hope she hears me now (woo, oh yeah)
La la la la, la la la la la la
La la la la, la la la la la la
La la la la, la la la la la la
La la la la, la la la la la la

She's a good girl (la la la la la la la la la la)
She's such a good girl (la la la la la la la la la la)
She's a good girl (la la la la la la la la la la)
Feels so good
She feels so good (la la la la la la la la la la)
She feels so good (la la la la la la la la la la)
She feels so good (la la la la la la la la la la)
Oh, she's a good girl
She feels so good (woo, oh yeah, woo, oh yeah)
