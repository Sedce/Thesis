I breathe, I hear, but I don't believe it
My heart, it beats, but inside, I'm freezing
My hands, they shake, I've lost all the feeling
No air to take, you say that you're leaving
And there's no turning back this time
Gotta stay alive

Where do I go when I'm so alone?
Where do I turn when we were so close?
We try not to crash but we still collide
Tears I've cried, I'll survive, I'm alive

I'm stripped, I'm bare, I'm left here with nothing
I hold the wheel; don't know where I'm going
Your face, I see, in every reflection
No time, no space, I've lost all direction
And there's no turning back this time
Gotta stay alive

Where do I go when I'm so alone?
Where do I turn when we were so close?
We try not to crash but we still collide
Tears I've cried, I'll survive, I'm alive

I'm gonna get there someway
Through the tears and the rain
And any road I can take just to get me some place
Where all the scars on my heart
And all the lies in the dark
Disappear in the headlights
So bright, tonight, gonna drive them away

Where do I go when I'm so alone?
Where do I turn when we were so close?
We try not to crash but we still collide
Tears I've cried, I'll survive, I'm alive

I'm alive
