What if I told you it was all meant to be
Would you believe me?
Would you agree?
It's almost that feeling that we've met before
So tell me that you don't think I'm crazy
When I tell you that love has come here and now

A moment like this
Some people wait a lifetime for a moment like this
Some people search forever for that one special kiss
Oh, I can't believe it's happening to me
Some people wait a lifetime for a moment like this

Everything changes, but beauty remains
Somethings so tender, I can't explain
Oh, well I may be dreaming, but 'til I awake
Can't we make this dream last forever
And I cherish all the love that we shared

A moment like this
Some people wait a lifetime for a moment like this
Some people search forever for that one special kiss
Oh, I can't believe it's happening to me
Some people wait a lifetime for a moment like this

Could this be the greatest love of all?
I wanna know that you will catch me when I fall
So let me tell you this...
 (2x)
A moment like this
Some people wait a lifetime for a moment like this
Some people search forever for that one special kiss
Oh, I can't believe it's happening to me
Some people wait a lifetime for a moment like this
