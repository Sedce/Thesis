I been working double shift all night
Now bees make honey, I'm making mine
Good men are busy, all the time
I been working double shift all night
My line of work, oh it suits me fine
Split that apple and chuck that rind
Pull no wishbone, that ain't dry
My line of work, oh it suits me fine
Sweet you ramble, sweet you roll
All through the bedrock of my soul
I got more good luck than I'll ever use
All day and all night like a mule

Fat faced farmer, off'a my land
Cross me twice, you'll understand
Now me and Delia now we're more than friends
Fat faced farmer, off'a my land
See how high your monkey jumps
Peel that fruit back, now gimme some
Now let this evening do what it does
See how high your monkey jumps
I'm gearing up not to get small
I do it big or don't do it at all
Ain't got no baggage that I can't use
All day and all night like a mule

It's on back to work they say
Now pull your hammer high and straight
Lay your boards out and drag that rake
Get on back to work they say
Get what you got, return what you use
Now tell me young man: Whose dog are you?
Got bigger secrets than you do
All day and all night like a mule

My line of work suits me fine
My line of work suits me fine
My line of work suits me fine
My line of work
