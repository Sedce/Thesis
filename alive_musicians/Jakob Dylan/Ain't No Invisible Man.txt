That ain't me, I ain't no president's son
That ain't me, I ain't no president's son
And now my daddy's the king he ain't second to anyone
Now girl on that pony over here and let me on
Now girl on that pony over here and let me on
I'll run her ride ragged and put her to bed like she belong
I'm no, no, no, ain't no invisible man
I'm no, no, no, ain't no invisible man
Now you can see all my highs you know how solid I really am
The courtroom's in recess, I see the juries coming in
The courtroom's in recess, I see the juries coming in
And verdict won't matter, done nothing I wouldn't do again
I got no passion for hunting, I got to get my babies fed
I got no passion for hunting, got to get my babies fed
All their bellies got no ears they don't hear a word being said
I'm no, no, no, ain't no invisible man
I'm no, no, no, ain't no invisible man
Yeah you can see all my highs you know how solid I really am
I could eat a man whole, his mind body and his soul
Yes I could eat a man whole, his mind body and his soul
I'll devour his house and leave his wife out in the cold
See what I got is just what I'm gonna use
See what I got is just what I'm gonna use
I say a little bitty something is more than enough to pay my dues
I'm no, no, no, I ain't no invisible man
I'm no, no, no, I ain't no invisible man
Yeah you can see all my highs you know how solid I really am
