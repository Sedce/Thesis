Oh, it's a struggle, it's a scrape
It's all give and no take
Whatever it is now
Is right up to our waist
Oh, it's a pity, it's a shame
To see it all slip away
I've seen you worried babe
But never this way

We hold our ground
We don't kneel
If we go down we go
Down on our own shield

Oh, it's a river of tears
And we're in over our ears
In the dark it rides off with our better years
Oh, it's a bottomless well
It's a little overkill
It's the end of a dragon's tail
That's whipping around our heels

But we don't bow
We make no deals
Now we go down we go
Down on our own shield

In this corner ladies and gentlemen weighing in
All along my love for her is strong
We scaled pillars to be here tonight
It's not the kind'a trick that you get to pull twice

It's an ambush girl
It's a cold-blooded low down dirty world
I see them yellow lanterns walk
A circle around our bit of earth
It's a turn for the worse
It's off with their heads if they don't learn
We do this over their dead bodies
Before it's over mine or yours
We don't beg for mercy dear
We go down we go
Down on our own shield

Down we go
Down on our own shield
Down we go
