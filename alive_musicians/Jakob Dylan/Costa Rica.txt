Lay your worries
Down at your door
Now my loves
Like an open shore
Throw your suitcase
Sweetheart overboard
Now tired eyes
In winter clothes
You ain't got nothing
You can't let go
Now tell your mother
You love her
She already knows
Now Costa Rica
We got nothing to do
Yeah
When the nights
Hang dark
And the sun
Won't burn
You may or may not
Ever return
Going under with you
Now thumb nail moon
Hanging high
So quiet up
There shining bright
Now dance a little
And share
This bottle of wine
No more ups
No more downs
Now love of someday
Has just come around
Watching the clouds
Flowing by while
Our skins
Turning brown
Now Costa Rica
We got
Nothing to do
Yeah
When the nights
Hang dark
And the sun
Won't burn
We may or may not
Ever return
Going under
With you
Now every moments
Been leading to this
We're going somewhere
We won't be missed
Now roll us
Under the waves
With one last kiss
Now when the nights
Hang dark
And the sun
Don't burn
We May or may
Not ever return
Costa Rica
With you, with you
May not we may not
Ever return
May not we may not
Ever return
May not we may not
Ever return
May not we may
Not ever return
