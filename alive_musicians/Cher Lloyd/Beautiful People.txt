It's my last big breath, what you want me to do?
When you act all cool like you already knew
That I'll be stuck here cold just waiting it through
'Til your heart starts beating for that somebody new
You know that it's true

Cause it's beautiful people like you
Who get whatever they want
And it's beautiful people like you
Who suck the life right outta my heart
And it's beautiful people like you
Who make me cry
Cause nobody else could be nearly as cruel as you

It's a wicked game that you're making me play (making me play)
Where I crawl back home as you're walking away (hey, hey)
And it's all quite clear what you want me to say (what you want me to say)
But you'll be so long gone if I ask you to stay
You know that it's true

Cause it's beautiful people like you
Who get whatever they want
And it's beautiful people like you
Who suck the life right outta my heart
And it's beautiful people like you
Who make me cry
Cause nobody else could be nearly as cruel as you
Cruel as you
As you

Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

It's my last big breath, what you want me to do?
When you act all cool like you already knew

Cause it's beautiful people like you
Who get whatever they want
And it's beautiful people like you
Who suck the life right outta my heart
And it's beautiful people like you
Who make me cry
Cause nobody else could be nearly as cruel as you
Nobody else could be nearly as cruel as you
As you
