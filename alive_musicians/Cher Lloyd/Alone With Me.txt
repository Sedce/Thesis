We can be the Bonnie and the Clyde of a new day
We can be a Johnny and a June if you want me boy
But I’m over here in the corner, boy
Dreaming about us together
If you wanna go to heaven I'll take ya
If you wanna get a little hot, I’m on fire boy
But I’m over here in the corner, boy
Dreaming about us together

Yeah, you…
You dance with everyone but
You don’t even know
It’s me that you should hold
Yeah, you
You dance with everyone but
They can all go home
Cause I want you alone
With me

Me, with me
I want you alone with me
Me, with me
I want you alone with…

I could be a diamond in the rough, come and find it
You could be a Jekyll or a Hyde, I can take you boy
But I’m over here in the corner, boy
Feels like I’ve waited forever
If you ever wanted someone to know ya
I could be the only one who knows how to get you, boy
But I’m over here in the corner, boy
Feels like I’ve waited forever

While, you…
You dance with everyone but
You don’t even know
It’s me that you should hold
Yeah, you
You dance with everyone but
They can all go home
Cause I want you alone
With me

Me, with me
I want you alone with me
Me, with me
I want you alone with…

Yeah, we can be living large
I'll take you up to the stars
So why are we still apart?
Yeah, we can be living large
I'll take you up to the stars
So why are we still apart?

If you ever want someone to know ya
I could be the only one who knows how to get you, boy
Yeah, I want you alone
Yeah, I want you alone
With me

Me, with me
I want you alone with me
Me, with me
I want you alone with me

Yeah, we can be living large
I'll take you up to the stars
So are we still apart?
I want you alone with me
Yeah, we can be living large
I'll take you up to the stars
So why are we still apart?

I want you alone with me
