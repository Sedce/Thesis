In the clouds where the angels sing
In her eyes, where I wanna be and her smile is all I see
She knows I need her loving
She knows I need her touching
She plays with my heart and emotion
I give her my love and devotion
She gives thoughts and a notion
I need her body, it needs me too

I need somebody to love me blue

I've been doing it wrong for too long
I said I've been at it wrong for too long
I've been doing it wrong for too long

In the clouds where the angels sing
It's her smile, yeah, it's all I see
In her eyes where I wanna be
She knows I need her loving
She knows I need her touching
She plays with my heart and emotion
I give her my love and devotion
She gave me her thought and a notion
I need her body, she needs me too

I need somebody to love
Love me blue
Love me blue
Love me blue
Love me blue
