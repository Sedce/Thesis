I'mma do it like it ain't been done
I'mma do it like it ain't been done (Go)
I'mma do it like it ain't been done
I'mma do it like it ain't been done (Go)

Can't beat me I'm a show sharp winner
One of a kind, I'm original
I'm so ill, I'mma need a painkiller
Stealing the show like a criminal

Don’t fight follow the leader
Give a little and you might get some
This one is for the non-believers
All together now, everyone

I'mma do it like it ain't been done
On top only just begun
Better believe I'll be your number one
I'mma do it like it ain't been done
And I hope you're holding on
‘Cause I'm going, going, gone
I'mma do it like it ain't been done
I'mma do it like it ain't been done
I'mma do it like it ain't been done
I'mma do it like it ain't been done

Both hands tied and I get gold medals
Still alive and I’m going hard
Make my mark and I'm breaking all records
You know me, I'm a superstar

Don’t fight follow the leader
Give a little and you might get some
This one is for the non-believers
All together now, everyone

I'mma do it like it ain't been done
On top only just begun
Better believe I'll be your number one
I'mma do it like it ain't been done
I hope you're holding on
‘Cause I'm going, going, gone
I'mma do it like it ain't been done
I'mma do it like it ain't been done

Like it ain't been done
Like it, like it ain't been done
I'mma do it like it ain't been done
On top only just begun
Better believe I'll be your number one
I'mma do it like it ain't been done, yeah!

I'mma do it like it ain't been done
On top only just begun
(On top right now)
Better believe I'll be your number one
(better believe)
I'mma do it like it ain't been done
And I hope you're holding on
(I hope you're holding on)
‘Cause I'm going, going, gone
(I'm going, going, gone)
I'mma do it like it ain't been done
I'mma do it like it ain't been done
(Ain't been done, huh, sing it, go)
I'mma do it like it ain't been done
I'mma do it like it ain't been done
Better believe I'll be your number one
I'mma do it like it ain't been done
I hope you're holding on
‘Cause I'm going, going, gone
I'mma do it like it ain't been done
I'mma do it like it ain't been done
