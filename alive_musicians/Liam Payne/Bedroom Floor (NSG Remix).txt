You be saying real, real nice, real nice things
When I’m touching you
You be getting real, real, real, real, real jealous
When it wasn’t you, oh
And every now when my iPhone, iPhone rings
I be telling you
I told you, I told you, I told you

It's the remix
If you want it, yeah you want it, you're all that I need
Girl stop frontin', go whine up on me
If you want it, yeah you want it, you're all that I need, yeah
Girl stop frontin', go whine up on me

You said it was over
You said it was over
But your clothes say different on my bedroom floor
You said it was over
You said it was over
But your clothes say different on my bedroom floor
But your clothes say
Hey its a vibe, so you always find yourself coming by
Baby you know you don't owe me time
Baby you know you don't owe me time
But your clothes say
Hey its a vibe, so you always find yourself coming by
Baby you know you don't owe me time
Baby you know you don't owe me time
Baby I like the way you're moving naughty
If you eat the cake like it's your birthday
Cause I know you really really want me
Cause I know you really really want me
On the bedroom floor, in the bedroom with me
Can't you tell I'm a bedroom bully?
Give it to you good, so so good
Got your friends wishing they were you

You said it was over
You said it was over
But your clothes say different on my bedroom floor
You said it was over
You said it was over
But your clothes say different on my bedroom floor
But your clothes say...
Wait, it's the same episode, right here, where we go girl
Just relax and ease
Come on, let me give you what you need
But your clothes say
Wait, it's the same episode, right here, where we go girl
Just relax and ease
Come on, let me give you what you need

You be saying real, real nice, real nice things
When I’m touching you
You be getting real, real, real, real, real jealous
When it wasn’t you, oh
And every now when my iPhone, iPhone rings
I be telling you
I told you, I told you, I told you
You don' even call my phone
Stop lying, it's all lies
I'm tryna call you from the morning to next night
Hey, 
Hey, there you go, 
Gyal everytime you say that its over (it's over)
See its only dat when you're sober
So when that wine kick in
Girl you on a feeling, its me you pull over
She a call be a bedroom bully, anytime that she jump on woody

Keep calling for me

You said it was over
You said it was over
But your clothes say different on my bedroom floor
You said it was over
You said it was over
But your clothes say different on my bedroom floor
But your clothes say...
What your clothes say, what your clothes say
