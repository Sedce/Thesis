( Emmylou Harris - Anna McCarrigle)
All I left behind should come as no surprise
To me since I fell through the black hole of your eyes
Only little things inconsequential I could say
Of all I left behind with you along the lost highway
Silver earrings in Wichita, beaded moccasins in Tonapah
But I had you so I just let them go
The flannel shirt I wore to keep me from the cold
When we drove from Boston all the way to Buffalo
The leather boots I bought so many miles ago
I took them off to follow you into the Ohio
Never did my armor feel so thin
Silk was all I had between me and your skin
Like waterloo I lost that too
And the gold bracelet with my fathers name inscribed
On the back by the one who loved him all her life
The way I too could have loved you
Spanish shawl I put across the broken shade
Of the lamp that lit the room that last night near Cour d'Alene
Only little things inconsequential I could say
Of all I left behind with you along the lost highway
Of all I left behind...
