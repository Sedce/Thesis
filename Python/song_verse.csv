Song Title,text
Music is the Healing force of the Universe,   Life is music Music is played listened to danced to Sometimes not understood but felt Music causes all bad vibrations to fade away It makes one want to love instead of hate It puts the mind in a healthy state of thought. It reconciles unites becomes oneness It brings about a state of wholeness and purifies Oh let it come in Oh let it come in The music of the universe The music of love Be healed.    It's never complete it is a being It's always there To feel To let in To become obsessed by To be healed by So open up your door And let it come in Let it into the very interior of your soul Sometime our very soul is in need of spiritual medication We do not always need the pill and its contents Just open up your heart and soul and let it come in Oh let it come in Oh let it come in

Come On,   Many times we've been so out of tune with it  Many times we've never known the way  All the people all around never telling nobody  All the people all around never telling a soul     Many times we've been so out of tune with it  Many times we've never let it show  All the people all around never telling nobody  All the people all around never telling a soul 
Dennis,   Deeper waters flowed Recently it showed Tryin' to cover your head Tryin' to frighten you Tryin' to fight with you Really gettin' you scared But don't you worry you love of mine Pretty soon it will all be fine And we'll just go on  Higher hills to climb Climbin' all the time Tryin' to find a way through Fallin' down again on the ground again Wonderin' what you can do But don't you worry you love of ours They look like weeds but they're really flowers And they'll soon be gone  You won't stand up you won't sit down Your head's a mile above the ground And though we tend to scold you now I couldn't start to tell you how We couldn't start to tell you how There's just no way to say how much we love you  You little Dennis you You're full of new surprise Love you You little Dennis with the rascal in your eyes You're a prize  It could be bad it could be worse You're taking out your mother's purse And though you cried when you got told The money there was for the old To keep their dogs from getting cold The only thing that can't be sold is love  You little Dennis you You're full of new surprise Love you You little Dennis with the rascal in your eyes  Will you pick up your toys? Will you be a good boy? Will you please please?
Just A Chance,   I won't tell you if it's short or long All I know is that it don't feel wrong You may say it's not a great romance But all we want from you is just a chance to try Any way we can Don't you think we know it has to hurt Won't you understand?
Know One Knows,   Keep it coming keep it long Caress me with your body song Reach it higher with each sigh Knowing soon that we will fly    Keep it moving keep it bright And guide me with your body light Come in closer with each sigh Knowing soon that we will fly    Keep on feeling keep it whole And lead me with your body soul Take me higher with each sigh Knowing you can make me fly
Rock N' Roll Contract,   Wrapped up in a rock 'n' roll contract  Lots of things I had to sign at the time  Man told me not to worry 'bout the business  Just keep on poppin' those hits     Sat down in my pyramid mansion  Old Martin seems to know all the chords  Tired of beggin' I can make it without them  Played the blues so I wouldn'Â­t get bored 
Three Time Loser,    And you know just where you stand  But it's hard to make the plan  When all that you do is wrong  And no one to find a song to play  
Too Hung Up On You,nan
Gloomy Sunday,   Little white flowers Will never awaken you Not where the black coach Of sorrow has taken you Angels have no thoughts Of ever returning you Would they be angry If I thought of joining you    And prayers that are said I know Let them not weep Let them know that I'm glad to go Death is no dream
The Lonesome Road,   Weary totin' such a load Travelin' down that lonesome road Look down look down that lonesome road Before you travel on. Weary totin' it's such a load Whike I'm travelin' down travelin' down that lonesome old road
Before We Disappear,   Time aint nothing if it aint fast Taking everything that you ever had And giving nothing in return But a cold bed in the quiet earth     Life aint nothing if it aint hard Itll show you who you truly are Knock you down when you get too tall Till you spun around in a free fall 
Bend In The Road,   I set off for the shore And I finally slipped away From the ones i adored And the place i was raised And I rode down the road Just to watch it go by And when and where is love? Maybe nowhere tonight
Circling,   Night falls while drunken angels Sleep by the side of the road And I'm nodding in a stairwell Just trying to stay out of the cold    Light breaks in through the window Takes a minute to know where I am A dying blackbird Gives her soul to the wind On the roof of the house That I can see from the bed    I'd crawl a hundred thousand miles Just to see your two eyes look me over I'd steal you flowers in the bloodshot light Of the lonely hours on a moonless night Just like a stray dog in the rain I can run all night and get nowhere I picture you out underneath the porch light Calling my name all night And waiting for me    Circling around the drain Hope that I make it home I never felt so far away Dark is the heart That wanders.
Dead Wishes,   Staring in the mirror with two borrowed eyes Looking for the part of me that's still alive Waiting for my chest to fall and rise Standing on the corner With my shirt tucked in Summer turns to autumn winter turns to spring And it all flies by like a speeding train    Waiting for the night to come and chase away All the flies hovering around my head With my memory for a pillow And all my regrets for a bed  Standing on the corner now I'm passed surprise Yelling out a warning to some passer by I stand just as God made me And I lie down in disguise    Standing on the corner don't apologize You don't have to bow your head or raise your eyes Or pretend that you don't see me
Higher Truth,   You can make somebody cry Go on Do what you like Ill be there by your side I know What the future holds  You can set the world on fire Yeah if you want It isnt hard I wont be there looking on To see the trail of lies As you fall    You can fill the world with pain Yeah if you want I've seen it now You can fill the world with hate Ive seen it done before And I know how it all works out  Make a promise if you can You know Youll only break it Make a promise if you dare Go on right ahead And lets see where it gets you    Come lets sit in the sun Feel the world spin around As the birds fly overhead Cant you hear the waves Cant you feel the rain As it falls upon your face    Ill take a truth A higher truth A higher truth I want the truth The higher truth A higher truth
Josephine,   Josephine where can you be now? Again the sun is rising on my troubled heart Dont deny you know you and I Are the making of what fate Just cant pull apart    Like a raven in a cage Blood on my birth Just wont wash away Like a stitched together doll My feet to the flame As I follow the blame For someone elses pain For someone elses pain
Let Your Eyes Wander,   When you find love And it gets away If it comes back to you Then it will stay Well maybe its true As dumb as it sounds I aint gonna stop you From looking around    Love can be sharp Make no mistake Flatter a good heart Then watch it break It'll cut you to the bone Just to see you bleed out But that doesnt mean no Im somebody else
Misery Chain,   Take the locks and shackles and melt all of it down. Shine a light upon every shadow every acre of ground. The hidden corners on in all around Anyway you feel this misery chain should be found.    And if I should fall from the top of the world To the depths below so far below where our believe could exist. Down further still will be the one who hides the key. And there's to try to put these misery chains on me.
Murderer Of Blue Skies,   You flew in on the wind Was a day that I won't forget Told me to let you in And that I would not regret it But you had a touch as cool as rain And only once the weather changed Murderer of blue skies    Now the truth will set you free But all you had was lying in you So you built a cage for me All the while pretending to be A living saint with a thorny crown And me condemned to be your clown I applaud you as you take a bow
Nearly Forgot My Broken Heart,   Every time I stare into the sun Trying to find a reason to go on All I ever get is burned and blind Until the sky bleeds the pouring rain  When you came along the time was right Pulled me like an apple red and ripe Wasn't very long you took a bite And did me wrong and it serves me right     Every little key unlocks the door Every little secret has a lie Try to take a picture of the sun And it won't help you to see the light  Every little word upon your lips Makes a little cut where blood pours out Every little drop of blood a kiss That I won't miss not for anything 
Only These Words,   In a castle Down a long road A little girl was born To a king and To a queen and Her mothers eyes welled up with tears of joy Staring at the tiny face Of a miracle she made She would say I love you She would say I love you  Summer came and went Unrolling trees all stripped to the bone Daddys little girl in his arms well They sit upon his throne Who is that thief hiding in the dark Just a little girl who stole his heart    With only these three words repeating A simple greeting but its all you keep Clever lips can be misleading A tongue can fly away And wont come back But its only these words we recognize  6 oclock A.M The alarm rings out Awoken from the dream No more castle down a long road No more kings and no more queens But shes a princess none the less And a handsome prince is what shell get
Our Time In The Universe,   Save the dying arms of midnight For the patience and or lapse of light Cuz its our time in the universe Well I dont mind If we're blessed or cursed And its our time in the universe Yours and mine    Save the dying arms of midnight Cuz its our time in the universe Well I dont mind If we're blessed or cursed Well its our time in the universe Yours and mine  See you dont fall No matter the end See it unfold no matter the need See it fold up whatever happens to be Its what it will be Its what it will be
Through The Window,   The clouds that gathered turned to rain The candles on your sill burned out The weather on your face Turned to match the mood outside  Reading through poems that you saved That make the gloomy hours make sense Or do they lose their power With the yellowing of age    I wish that I could find a seed And plant a tree that grows so high So that I could climb And harvest the ripe stars For you and I to drink And spit the ashes from our mouths And put the grey back in the clouds And send them packing with our bags Of old regrets and sorrows 'Cause they don't do a thing but drag us down So far down The past is like a braided rope Each moment tightly coiled inside
Worried Moon,   Worried moon shining bright Can I sleep here tonight right beside you? I got a long way to go I'll be off in the morning And I hope but I don't know If she will have me back again Or only want me for a friend And leave a stain across my heart That never washes out     Nervous moon In the clouds There's a halo around your proud face And I'm glad that we're friends I might see you again Sooner or later I guess     There you are looking down I'll be here on the ground if you need me As I dream of a ghost Of a love that has died  Or maybe not but it haunts me now 
Wrong Side,   When I was just a boy of ten My father met a miners death Trapped inside through twenty nights No one made it out alive So there I was alone but free The master of my destiny And trouble found me right away My close companions since that day    At 21 I fell in love To a girl of 16 years But a jealous father ran me down Left me in the road for dead So I decided there and then Id find the car Id take revenge But the fire caught the house and fields I havent slept a whole night since

Weak not poor children the life is this way Murdering beauty and passion Hush now little children It must be this way to weary of life and exception Rest now my children for soon we'll away Into the calm and the quite Uh Uh Uh..
Flying Easy,   We're flying high on a velvet sky With the wind on our wings Climbing easily on the breeze    The trip is smooth and we gently glide We ride the rainbow and we see to a tee How happy it can be to be free  We float and there is no thought of time Cause were singing of love And the pleasure is so devine
I Know It's You,   Nothing feels better than my baby's arms They've around me a long time Nothing feels better than some good news Makes you glad to face the new times  I tell you nothing's better When there's no need to look 'Cause you know who's there I smile the world over  When I think of the past How we past all the test Through the good and the bad And that's why I wanna see it by now    Home is the castle you built in my mind I'm home anywhere anytime Peaceful and patience easy taken time It's so nice to have a simple mind  I tell you nothing's better When there's no need to look 'Cause you know who's there I smile the world over    No I ain't got nobody else in mind 'Cause I know it's you That's the reason I wanna stay right here 'Cause I ain't got nobody else in mind I know it's you [outro No I ain't got nobody else in mind I know it's you

Magdalena,   Magdalena sits in her chair speaking of the mass She talks in slicing splinters she laughs like breaking glass She says that she would have me spirit her away Stealing all my images 'til there's nothing left to say     Magdalena lying there could make a dancer stumble Make a preacher bite his tongue and leave him with a mumble And if you think I'm crazy babe or that I'm funning you Just pay your dues and lose your blues When Maggie is kissing you 
Someday We'll All Be Free,   Hang on to the world as it spins around Just don't let the spin get you down Things are moving fast Hold on tight and you will last Keep your self respect your manly pride Get yourself in gear Keep your stride Never mind your fears Brighter days will soon be here Take it from me someday we'll all be free yeah Keep on walking tall Hold your head up high Lay your dreams right up to the sky Sing your greatest song And you'll keep going going on
A Distorted Reality is Now a Necessity to be Free,"   I'm floating in a black balloon O.D. on Easter afternoon My mama told me ""Baby stay clean There's no in-between"" And all you ladies and you gentlemen Between is all you've ever seen or been Fit poorly and arrange the sight Doll it up in virgin white You disappoint me you people raking in on the world The devil's script sells you the heart of a blackbird    Sun's rising on a chopping glare Rain dropping acid bought up in the air A distorted reality is now a necessity to be free It's so disappointing First I put it all down to luck God knows why my country don't give a fuck Fuck"
A Passing Feeling,nan
Coast To Coast,   Last stop for a resolution End of the line into confusion So go go see what's there for you Nothing new Nothing new for you to use  I've got no new act to amuse you I've got no desire to use you no But anything that I could do Would never be good enough for you  If you can't help it then just leave it alone Leave it alone (Leave it alone) Yeah just forget it It's really easy I believe I'll forget it too  Still you're keeping me around 'Til I finally drag us both down (Gonna drag us both down) Pulling feathers out your hat (Throwing feathers out your hat) Yes I believe it's come to that (I believe that's where it's at) You belong tagging along And I belong in the zoo
Don't Go Down,   I met a girl snowball in hell She was hard and as cracked as the Liberty Bell I got her to come on and move in with me And I said I'd find a better place we could spend eternity     Her mama called me a thief And her dad called himself commander-in-chief I fought him off with my love But I knew the sense of worthlessness she'd have to rise above     She had a dream woke up in shock She had seen her own body outlined in chalk I split the scene the globe'd been spun And her ghost leaned down to kiss me With a message from the sun
King's Crossing,   The king's crossing was the main attraction Dominos are falling in a chain reaction The scraping subject ruled by fear told me Whiskey works better than beer  The judge is on vinyl decisions are final And nobody gets a reprieve And every wave is tidal If you hang around You're going to get wet    It's Christmas time And the needles on the tree A skinny Santa is bringing something to me His voice is overwhelming But his speech is slurred And I only understand every other word Open your parachute and grab your gun Falling down like an omen a setting sun Read the part and we turn out fine It's a hell of a role if you can keep it alive But I don't care if I fuck up I'm going on a date With a rich white lady Ain't life great? Give me one good reason not to do it (Because we love you) So do it
Let's Get Lost,nan
Little One,   The moonlight tonight Seems to belong to me Cause I Even those who cant sleep (Never go to sleep) They need some company   One hit Wouldn't hurt a bit at all Slow down (Stay down) See whats there to find (See whats there today)  If it's (If its) Good shit you won't know (gonna be) And I won't know (ok) The fact that I'm dying (all done)  If I seem to be reckless with myself It's the fault of no one All things have a place Under the moon As well as the sun
Memory Lane,    The mayor's name is fear His force patrols the pier From a mountain of cliché That advances everyday   The doctor spoke a cloud He rained out loud Youll keep your doors and windows shut And swear you'll never show a soul again but     Uncomfortable apart It's all written on my chart And I take what's given to me Most cooperatively   I do what people say And lie in bed all day Absolutely horrified I hope you're satisfied 
Pretty (Ugly Before),   Sunshine Been keeping me up for days There is no nighttime It's only a passing phase And I feel pretty Pretty enough for you I felt so ugly before I didn't know what to do
Shooting Star,   You'll make the scene Like you always do Going upstream Down the avenue To fuck some trophy boy That you'll win tonight at the bar     When it was me I was momentarily proud Drunk on dreams Now I'm glad I didn't say out loud You said you'd be for real But I don't believe that you are     I'm going to sleep now Going back to find square one Square two be where I can deal with the shit you just done It won't be soon Say the least it's gonna be hard 
Strung Out Again,   You get what you see I saw a rich fuck giving charity Saw an evil emperor Wearing my clothes  They're far from the best But they might suit you better than the rest Just looking in the mirror Will make you a brave man     Was a parliament of owls Fly over a city of canals Floating on the body Floating in the Dalles  You get what you see But some things they just change invisibly I don't know where I'm going And I don't even want to know  
The Last Hour,   Here's the army that you mowed to the ground And the bodies you left lying around Talking it out The last hour I'm through trying now It's a big relief I'll be staying down Where no one else gonna give me grief     Your opinion was the law of the land The single thing that I could always understand I lived it out from hour to hour The only thing that never really changed You ran me all around And dragged me down At the end of the day     I've been thinking of the things that I missed Situations that I passed up for this One-way love I took for hours I'm through trying now It's a big relief I'll be staying down I wasn't good at being a thief 
Twilight,   Haven't laughed this hard in a long time I better stop now before I start crying Go off to sleep in the sunshine I don't want to see the day when it's dying  She's a sight to see (sight to see) she's good to me (good to me) But I'm already somebody's baby She's a pretty thing (pretty thing) and she knows everything (everything) But I'm already somebody's baby
Drowning in Your Eyes,   Feel the ground it's slipping away Like a sigh that greets the close of day Feel the waters welcoming arms Embrace me in their quiet karma I can't hear what you say anymore Just the sound of trees on the ocean floor Irresistibly drawn from the shore    Moving slowly as if in a dream The colors change from blue to green All around me reflections of you In forests deep I'm passing through In the swell of the storm we're as one We're dancing in the morning sun Could it be that we've only just begun    I'm drowning in your eyes I'm floating out to sea Helpless on the restless tide That flows between you and me
Mortal Seed,   From this mortal seed Turning deep inside There's a wound which cannot bleed For the pleasures we have been denied All you want to be only we can decide Try to get ahead but standing Like a statue on the edge You talk about a new direction But the words fly out and disappear High windows shine the light seems like a sign But there's a crowd down there laughing But don't seem to hear Oh it's the same today always just the same as before Can't be the same today step out don't be afraid You've got the right got the right for more
Sad Song,   Back room parlor lonely sits and cries See her with her head in hands But nothing at all in her eyes Always listening for the telephone But it only rings wrong numbers Or whenever she's not at home    Late night cafe's closing on the street He's turning out to hide in doorways Any corner that others sleep Empty bottle spirits he has known A vision of a quiet face Together they look like home    Thinking life would pass him by He opens up his arms to reach for the sky Broken dreams they never came true So now he paints himself a sad song And colors it blue 
American Leather,   Looking for a way out I put my foot out of line Really like to break-out I feel so confined    Saw you on a dark road Brought myself along Got a sense of conflict But I know what's wrong    I know that kinda feeling So I built my place up high But you'll never find me kneeling Cause I'm too occupied
Caught In My Eye,   Though your dark eyes You can feel my Every sin When I walk right Into a straight line This world of yours I got you caught in my eye again    There's a door there That opens Without you And the door lies With its open keys To my room
Communist Eyes,   I'm looking through Communist eyes I'm seeing planes in bloodshot skies I see the flag of a working people Who conceal the lies in the stars And sickle It's a double edge    I'm looking through Communist eyes All I see is an old man's alibi There's a world outside But I'm unaware I open my books but the pages stare It's a double edge
Dragon Lady,   You walk to the temple on the boulevard You know the way in cause you're The son of God She opens the door with A sardonic glance You drop to the floor making your plans     There's something in her eyes That nature denied She's a whirlwind creature of cultural ties A preacher of schemes and self denial She talks up a storm with news and belial    To live in Braham tragedy Driven it seems by fantasies A life like this is sad to see A smile kept quite in reverie The clock on the matle hands stop crossed The rug on the floors a resting place for the dust The talk of the town yet she's never been seen A loving relation with a well trained machine
Land of Treason,   Old hearts gone- The future's on-mother nations mired  I like a recepticle for the chosen dead  We find our bodies clawed  And with the scent of death  We find that we are not so very awed   Loyalties burned- The words our blurred-overturn your own 
Let's Pretend,   That thing in your bed's just another whore That tear in your eyes not a tear at all  For that girl that you touch you could never fall  That stream in your mind it's a tearin' sty      Your leather is tight but you wear it full  'Gether is right but you gotta be cool  You cut your wrists but you don't feel the pain  You change your mind but you still feel the same  To dream ain't your kind just another lie...       Sell us a story that we can believe  Spend your dollars on pills for relief  Love is a future that you still can't see  Standing answers to questions are free  Scream in your boredom life's just to die   Let's pretend you're vicious 
Lexicon Devil,   I want toy tin soldiers that can push and shove I want gun boy rovers that'll wreck this club I'll build you up and level your heads We'll run it my way cold men and politics dead    I'll get silver guns to drip old blood Let's give this established joke a shove We're gonna wreak havoc on this rancid mill I'm searchin' for something even if I'm killed    Empty out your pockets you don't need their change I'm giving you the power to rearrange Together we'll run to the highest prop Tear it down and let it drop away
Manimal,   I crossed the paths of right and wrong - And saw them take their toll I saw armies that marched And like animals they crawled    Evolution is a process too slow To save my soul But I've got this creature on my back And it just won't let go
Media Blitz,   Don't steal your eyes off the TV screen Can you realize we're what we've seen Take an injection from the mad machine Don't read the papers read between the lines We're vision rapers and we seed the signs You'll play your part in the master mind
Our Way,nan
Richie Dagger's Crime,   He sits in his corner like a child despised A crazy sort of cast comes over his eyes- That's Richie Dagger's crime  He's that sort of boy that was never much loved His idea of fun was society's grudge- That's Richie Dagger's crime  His life was such a mess And his friends weren't quite the best But he was satisfied- That's Richie Dagger's crime Suck me in and spit me out Devour me in haste-
Shut Down,   Let me touch the tips of inculcated desire And brush the fettered veil away Shut down in the depths I lay... If you want nothin' then I've got nothin' I'm your annihilation man Lemme get control I've got your minds Now I want Your souls lemme get control I've got your minds Now I want control I need control... If you want somethin' then I've got somethin' I'm your annihilation man...
Strange Notes,nan
The Other Newest One,   I feel your body's close to mine I hear your breath and mine in time I know I'm nothing but it's you that I need I touch your skin and it starts to feed You're not the first you're not the last Another day another crash    Embracing my life between your thighs We will perform in the deadly skies Reducing my mind to endless nights You send my dreams to their demise Realized by your last breath  I take your hair into my hands I pull it tight to fill your demands I feed my body into yours I know it's right cause that's my soul you stir  You're not the first you're not the last Another day another crash
The Slave,   You put your hands together Writhe in the shackle You twist your body round 'Til it starts to crackle You do the slave to the beat Of the neuro-sutra can can...
We Must Bleed,   It's Sunday and the streets aren't clear The traffic's screaming But we can't hear The sounds the metals Driving us mad The sounds the metals Driving us mad The sounds the metals Driving us mad Driving us mad oh Driving us mad We must bleed we must bleed We must bleed we must bleed
What We Do Is Secret,   Standing in the line we're abberations Defects in a defect's mirror And we've been here all the time Real fixations Hidden deep in the furor- What we do is secret-secret!    Licensed to drill with the torch In our lives Walking on shallow water Progressed to the Point of no distinction Dementia of a higher order- What we do is secret-secret!
"Hey, Jealousy",   Tell me do you think it'd be all right If I could just crash here tonight You can see I'm in no shape for driving And anyway I've got no place to go And you know it might not be that bad You were the best I'd ever had If I hadn't blown the whole thing years ago I might not be alone 
Dance On,nan
My Way,   And now the end is near And so I face the final curtain My friends I say it clear I'll state my case of which I'm certain I've loved a life that's full I've travelled each and every highway And more much more than this I did it my way  Regrets I had a few But then again too few to mention I did what I had to do And saw it through without excemption I planned each chattered course Each careful stap along the highway And more much more than that I did it my way   Yes there were times I'm sure you knew When I bit more off then I could chew   But through it all when there was doubt I ate it up and spitt it out I faced it all and I stood tall And did it my way  I've loved I've laughed and cried I've had my fill my share of losing And now as tears subside I find it all so amusing To think I did all that And may I say not in a shy way Oh no oh no not me I did it my way  For what is a man What has he got If not himelf than he has not To say the words he truly feels And not the words of one who kneels The record shows I took the blows And did it my way
So Long,   Now I was lookin' for love In all the wrong places Lookin' for love Starin' into black faces  Now I was tryin' so hard to find love In every corner of the city Lookin' for love All over town
When I Get Home,   When I get home I'm gonna sit on my bed When I get home The feed back in my head When I get home I won't answer the phone    When I get home I knew it ain't no sceen When I get home You knew I take of my skin When I get home I dance around in my doors
Breeding,"   If I say red the bugs insist on yellow If I say right the bugs point east It's unbearable we're indivisible I begin to spew lies  Unable to cross over with just a smile I become a demon child Holding up the thorns even beloved memories become all bloody  No matter how I try to tame the two insects It's water and oil parallel lines that run on forever Appearing unpredictably They whisper in turn  ""That kid is great... break him down"" ""It'll only hurt you - just give up"" Those voices in turn Call out in my head  Those two bugs are growing up inside my body Am I the one who's really being raised?    No matter how I try to tame the two insects It's water and oil parallel lines that run on forever Appearing unpredictably They whisper in turn  In my skull flying around Well matched with me are two insects When they whisper I cannot defy them Am I being raised?"
ever free,"   I've forgotten the season that I dreamt of in my dreams So I try asking that girl When I do you said with a smile ""Can dreams be eaten?""  When I look upon these days that are coming to an end I remember the faded sunny days  The disappearing melodies from the beginning Where did I lose them?"
Hurry go round,   With off season blooms One season flows endlessly into the next The joke plays out again Just like it did on that day  When ivy leaves unnoticed Spread their roots The scene greeting me Slipped away without a sound  I aim for the distance beyond And kick old memories away Not because they're sad But they aren't happy either  To gain wisdom A fleeting moment is never enough It was but an instant of clarity That flashed by me yesterday    Supposing a ripe fruit Were to wither and fall unseen Its sweetly intoxicating fragrance Would still have adorned one season   Ivy will spread I will perish away And a fragment of memory will return to the ground Perhaps to become a flower again Like a merry-go-round & round Let's meet in the spring again  It spins and spins And even the tears and the rain Twinkling from fragments of distant memories Will be swallowed into the sands (2) [outr] Hurry go round even though you may shatter Because it's a fleeting instant before you fall Without waiting for the right moment Spin Hurry merry-go-round Even if life pulls you under Let's meet in the spring again Let's meet in the spring Let's meet in the spring

Pink Spider,"   Ignoring the captured butterfly's desperate plea You glare at the sky ""I didn't hurt because I hated I didn't have wings And the sky was too high"" [verse ""You should use my wings SPIDER You don't know the pain of endless flight And maybe you'll realize one day That you were only flying in the palms of someone else And even dared to call that freedom.""

Before Our Spring,   Actually looking at you Watching over you makes me happy Just looking at you smiling Just watching over you makes me feel at peace    Actually I dont want spring to come Dont want it to get warmer Just looking at you smile from afar Makes my heart ache
Grease,   Black grease It wont come off its like you Its on your white shirt All over It even feels dirty (dirty) Yea its like you Disgustingly spread out Meeting eyes with you was my fault Its my fault that I didnt know about myself    I did nothing wrong If I had to choose its that I got to know you I was crazy I tried to make things right But whats so good about you? What do I have to lose? After I met you I only regret If I had the chance to erase it all I wish I could beg the kids who know you So I dont have to know you anymore Crazy crazy I was crazy I want to turn it all back
Im So Curious,   Im looking at your eyes they shine so black Dont move I wanna place you completely in my head I dont wanna be bland I wanna hold your hand  The back of your neck your ant waist I wanna see everything from up close Im getting greedy I wanna see everything closely I wanna get to know you  When I meet eyes with you When your hands brush against mine I get sad because I wish for one more second Put your skin on me dont take it away    Dont get away from me dont go far away Im like a puppy left alone Im trembling I dont know what to do Isnt it sad?

Just for a day,   Donât do this you keep appearing Itâs over itâs all in the past I open my eyes I close them But even in my dreams itâs you    Iâm not in your today anyway You know that I canât go on for a single day Even when Iâm drunk and swaying and want to lean I canât
Only One You Need,   The fingertip facing me Im still afraid. I know its full I understand it because it is you too oh Two eyes clear reason Reasons why the bottom of the ear lobe was hot Mood at ones fingertips    Im trying to please you right here I just gotta blow oh You and I are missing that piece I wanna be the only one The only one you need Its always beautiful. It seems to collapse. It soon shines like an explosion. The more uneasy the more Even if the whole body is torn and scattered I will not cover everything. I got you here I blew you. Its okay.    You and I are missing that piece I wanna be the only one The only one you need I can not wait for you Disturbed form looks dangerous yeah Yeah relax let me do it. I can not just look at you like me.
Rewind,   Whatever I do time passes Im tired let me get a glass of water Whatever I do time passes Im tired theres something on the floor Whatever I do time passes Its wet I should clean it up Whatever I do my eyelids are heavy Ill be alert so you focus too    Whatever I do time passes One more drink Im so out of it Whatever I do time passes My right shoulder is stiff Whatever I do time passes Whatever you say Whatever I do Whatever you say
Sentimental,   When I quietly close my eyes It feels like youre quietly next to me Sadly when my heart droops Feels like youll pat my shoulders    When I see myself eating when I see myself taking care of my body I think whats the point? But when I see you smiling Im shook Maybe its just my mood    When I quietly close my eyes It feels like youre quietly next to me Sadly when my heart droops Feels like youll pat my shoulders    I havent really changed either Im sure youre still the same too Its not like I wanna go back Not like I miss you but

Take The Dive,   When my small world met yours Then the waves arose Just one laugh Colors in my once colorless heart I will take the dive The strange tide feels deeper today Singing na na na na na I hesitated for a second Then Im diving    Let me loose in your ocean So I can only be filled with you I wanna know you From your surface to the other side of the ocean oh I
A Means to an End,   A legacy so far removed One day will be improved Eternal rights we left behind We were the better kind Two the same set free too     We fought for good stood side by side Our friendship never died On stranger waves the lows and highs Our vision touched the sky Immortalists with points to prove     A house somewhere on foreign soil Where ageless lovers call Is this your goal your final needs Where dogs and vultures eat Committed still I turn to go  
Atrocity Exhibition,   Asylums with doors open wide Where people had paid to see inside For entertainment they watch his body twist Behind his eyes he says 'I still exist.'     In arenas he kills for a prize Wins a minute to add to his life But the sickness is drowned by cries for more Pray to God make it quick watch him fall     You'll see the horrors of a faraway place Meet the architects of law face to face See mass murder on a scale you've never seen And all the ones who try hard to succeed     And I picked on the whims of a thousand or more Still pursuing the path that's been buried for years All the dead wood from jungles and cities on fire Can't replace or relate can't release or repair Take my hand and I'll show you what was and will be
Colony,   A cry for help a hint of anesthesia The sound from broken homes We used to always meet here As he lays asleep she takes him in her arms Some things I have to do but I don't mean you harm     A worried parent's glance a kiss a last goodbye Hands him the bag she packed the tears she tries to hide A cruel wind that blows down to our lunacy And leaves him standing cold here in this colony     I can't see why all these confrontations I can't see why all these dislocations No family life this makes me feel uneasy Stood alone here in this colony In this colony in this colony in this colony in this colony 
Decades,   Here are the young men the weight on their shoulders Here are the young men well where have they been? We knocked on the doors of Hell's darker chamber Pushed to the limit we dragged ourselves in Watched from the wings as the scenes were replaying We saw ourselves now as we never had seen Portrayal of the trauma and degeneration The sorrows we suffered and never were free     Weary inside now our heart's lost forever Can't replace the fear or the thrill of the chase Each ritual showed up the door for our wanderings Open then shut then slammed in our face 
Heart and Soul,   Instincts that can still betray us A journey that leads to the sun Soulless and bent on destruction A struggle between right and wrong You take my place in the showdown I'll observe witha pitiful eye I'll humbly ask for forgiveness A request well beyond you and I     An abyss that laughs at creation A circus complete with all fools Foundations that lasted the ages Then ripped apart at their roots Beyond all this good is the terror The grip of a mercenary hand When savagery turns all good reason There's no turning back no last stand     Existence well what does it matter? I exist on the best terms I can The past is now part of my future The present is well out of hand The present is well out of hand 
Isolation,   In fear every day every evening He calls her aloud from above Carefully watched for a reason Painstaking devotion and love Surrendered to self preservation From others who care for themselves A blindness that touches perfection But hurts just like anything else     Mother I tried please believe me I'm doing the best that I can I'm ashamed of the things I've been put through I'm ashamed of the person I am     But if you could just see the beauty These things I could never describe These pleasures a wayward distraction This is my one lucky prize 
Love Will Tear Us Apart,   When routine bites hard And ambitions are low And resentment rides high But emotions won't grow And we're changing our ways taking different roads     Why is the bedroom so cold? You've turned away on your side Is my timing that flawed? Our respect runs so dry Yet there's still this appeal That we've kept through our lives     You cry out in your sleep All my failings exposed And there's a taste in my mouth As desperation takes hold Just that something so good Just can't function no more  
Passover,   This is a crisis I knew had to come Destroying the balance I'd kept Doubting unsettling and turning around Wondering what will come next Is this the role that you wanted to live? I was foolish to ask for so much Without the protection and infancy's guard It all falls apart at first touch     Watching the reel as it comes to a close Brutally taking it's time People who change for no reason at all It's happening all of the time Can I go on with this train of events? Disturbing and purging my mind Back out of my duties when all's said and done I know that I'll lose every time     Moving along in our God given ways Safety is sat by the fire Sanctuary from these feverish smiles Left with a mark on the door Is this the gift that I wanted to give? Forgive and forget's what they teach Or pass through the deserts and wastelands once more And watch as they drop by the beach This is the crisis I knew had to come Destroying the balance I'd kept Turning around to the next set of lives Wondering what will come next
The Eternal,   Procession moves on the shouting is over Praise to the glory of loved ones now gone Talking aloud as they sit round their tables Scattering flowers washed down by the rain Stood by the gate at the foot of the garden Watching them pass like clouds in the sky Try to cry out in the heat of the moment Possessed by a fury that burns from inside     Cry like a child though these years make me older With children my time is so wastefully spent A burden to keep though their inner communion Accept like a curse an unlucky deal Played by the gate at the foot of the garden My view stretches out from the fence to the wall No words could explain no actions determine Just watching the trees and the leaves as they fall
Twenty Four Hours,   So this is permanence love-shattered pride What once was innocence turned on its side A cloud hangs over me marks every move Deep in the memory of what once was love     Oh how I realised how I wanted time Put into perspective tried so hard to find Just for one moment thought I'd found my way Destiny unfolded I watched it slip away     Excessive flash points beyond all reach Solitary demands for all I'd like to keep Let's take a ride out see what we can find A valueless collection of hopes and past desires     I never realised the lengths I'd have to go All the darkest corners of a sense I didn't know Just for one moment I heard somebody call Looked beyond the day in hand there's nothing there at all     Now that I've realised how it's all gone wrong Gotta find some therapy this treatment takes too long Deep in the heart of where sympathy held sway Gotta find my destiny before it gets too late
"The Endless Enigma Suite, Pt. 1",    Why do you stare? Do you think that I care? You've been misled By the thoughts in your head  Your words waste and decay Nothing you say Reaches my ears anyway  You never spoke a word of truth      Why do you think I believe what you said? Few of your words Ever enter my head  I'm tired of hypocrite freaks With tongues in their cheeks Turning their eyes as they speak  They make me sick and tired       I ruled all of the earth Witnessed my birth Cried at the sight of a man And still I don't know who I am       I've seen paupers as kings Puppets on strings Dance for the children who stare You must've seen them everywhere
"The Endless Enigma Suite, Pt. 2",   Each part was played Though the play was not shown Everyone came But they all sat alone  The dawn opened the play Waking the day Causing a silent hooray The dawn will break another day  Now that it's done Are we going to see the reason why I'm here
Get Up(with Common Ground),"   during the middle of the dark night i'm just standing. i can't even see in front of me to where i should go where would it be even if i look around me it's no use. in the river waters that is life endlessly as i float around like the floating plants (another translation is ""mulch""; basically the plant matter floating on the water surface) and when i touch some peaceful lake shore i will probably rot with the water.     between the endless words me and you are getting weary with another kind of action with another kind of word we console ourselves the more acknowledgement the novelty gets further and further away just going back and forth like a pendulum"
Where the Wind Rises(with Hareem),   Iâm going to the place the place where the wind blows To under the tree thatâs like your hair    Even if I get stopped by the rolling waves iâll look at the horizon To the place where the sun smiles; Iâm going to that place.  The place where the leaves beckon for me Iâm going to that place. As I walk and whistle I think of you.

Another Piece of Cake,   In all headlines of the day N'wonder what these papers want to say With news that only take you away From your own thoughts in new taxes to pay As long as these people don't smile All these news are just a waste of time So no use for you to hesitate 'cause in the end you're just another piece of cake
For All Mankind,"   We all know this worlds' going through some big changes It gets to the point where all phenomenon seem crazy People start looking for ways to live outside From the system that makes them all so blind Some try to find new fields to explore from outside Their heads some go in there and find that The richness of life is so easy to multiply Just by throwing away all the thoughts that keep us From learning to know the personality That lives inside us And tries to come out But facing it is the key to unwind From closing yourself as the surroundings provide    One day we will say goodbye To all of them who live the time No more need to compromise No more questions: ""tell me why"" This balanced heart needs no disguise But shamen seeds for all mankind The shamen seeds for all mankind"
"I'm the King, I'm the Sun","   ""Just do it boy No matter what you're up to  I'm telling you just do it boy""   ""I'll take care o' things up here  So you don't take the other way  I'm your captain relief I give light  And I let you play"" "
Party Goes On,   One day I'll finish everything that I have begun One day I'll explain h yes and you will understand Work now and rest later rest now and work later on? One day is someday but now I will have to go on Before it's over
Take You to Sweet Harmony,   As I hear you complain 'bout your life makes me Wonder if you'll get love tonight You have chosen everything I say all the time You had the alternate way Everything's wrapped together it seems all the Rights and resposabilites
The Real Thing,   She takes a drink and stands You just can't take your eyes of her bigure She laughs with her friend who ain't a man Now you're getting so so eager It's time to try your luck again But remember what I say    You tell her something sweet for starters Already you know it didn't sound too good You start to dream about her caress 'n' Try so hard to get her hooked You proove yourself but she looks away Remember what I said    She's the swan (s-van) where we all come from The most beautiful and healthy one*  Give the Lady but be sincere She'll give you much of what you need  Take her as a self-evidence You know she'll slap you in your face  And as the gardeners of this plan (-et) I think by now we all understand (stand under?)

Welcome to the Mirrorland,nan
Better Than Shit,   Everyone's a liar and I think I'm burning out it seems like life just ends the same way it begins so many die with nothing and so few ever win. And you can tell me what you want you can scream or even cry but if it passes through your leps I'm gonna know that it's a lie. Suppression creates depression so let your thought flow free just open up your mind and I promise you will see. Stay within the lines stel your spine make up your mind you're just like all the rest and you're wating my time.
For What It's Worth,   There's something happening here What it is ain't exactly clear. There's a man with a gun over there Telling me I've got to beware.    Paranoia strikes deep Into your heart it will creep. It happens when you're always afraid Step out of line and the man come to take you away.    It's time we stop hey what's that sound? Everybody look what's going down. Stop hey what's that sound? Everybody look what's going down.
No Such Thing,   In those streets I stumble over cracked concrete running in circles on tired feet. I'm sick of all this hatred it does no one no good if I could change the world you fucking bet I would. We are the new school its up to us to change the way things are to make things better. Fuck separatism we have to unite at all costs. Unconditional acceptance of people into our lives and scenes is the only way. Race age sex religion what you wear what music you like who you fuck... none of it matters. The adult society infested with snobbery and violence should bear no reflection on our underground. Instead of turning our backs to the new kids wanting to learn about our scenes we should teach them how it should be.
Packing Up,   Living a life governed by pain I step away from the fire but I carry the flame. My youth I'm proud I wear it on my sleeve my faceless generation's gonna make you see.    Remember the times of harmony and how I want them back wait until the time is right and then we will attack pride honor I wear it on my sleeve my faithless generation's gonna make you see.    Watch it all fall down around you while you sit safe at home we're packing up and moving on and you'll be left alone. The carefree world that used to be has fallen out of sight I want to take it back but it's going to be a fight.
The Truth of It,   No one could have helped you cause you never even thought you tried to run away from time but now you've gotten caught. I knew who you once were and watched you lose everything a sad and broken drunk who used to be a king    I'll try not to be selfish and only think of me but I've got too many problems to dwell inside your tragedy youth can last forever because age is in your head but you are neither young nor old; you're already dead. I'm not gonna do that
Halfway Right,"   I scream at myself when there's nobody else to fight I don't lose I don't win if I'm wrong then I'm halfway right Used to get high with the dead end kids Abandoned houses where the shadows lived I never been higher than I was that night I woke up driving my car I couldn't see then what I see right now The road dissolving like an empty vow Couldn't remember where I'd been that night I knew I took it too far     Told me ""Kid you're going way too fast You burn too bright you know you'll never last"" It was bullshit then I guess it makes sense now I woke up driving my car Said I'd lose you if I lost control I just laughed because what do they know? Here I am standing all alone Because I took it too far  "
Heavy (feat. Kiiara),   I dont like my mind right now Stacking up problems that are so unnecessary Wish that I could slow things down I wanna let go but theres comfort in the panic And I drive myself crazy Thinking everything's about me Yeah I drive myself crazy 'Cause I cant escape the gravity     You say that I'm paranoid But Im pretty sure the world is out to get me Its not like I make the choice To let my mind stay so fucking messy I know I'm not the center of the universe But you keep spinning 'round me just the same I know I'm not the center of the universe But you keep spinning 'round me just the same  
A Very Good Thing,   Do you remember the time I remember the time Like a boyhood nursery rhyme Just a voice inside my head Trying to get out  Do you remember the way Well I remember the way Like a night turned into day Well I dressed you up And your mother threw you back down    Do you remember the voice Yeah I remember the voice And it gave me no choice It was several of them And I had to take one out  I remember the time Yeah I remember the time Like a high school nursery rhyme And I pushed you in And I pushed you down 
Kim the Waitress,   Pursed lips and tender hips Turning in my head Writing poems in a corner booth That I'd die if she read Seeing her in but a silver cross Lying on her bed    Sometimes she comes with coffee Leaning over pouring I'd like to gently pull her to me Kiss her with no warning Seeing her some sunny Sunday morning    Though I don't stand a ghost of a chance with her She's pretty (and that bothers me) So pretty (and that bothers me) And it bothers me
She's Goin' Thru My Head,   She's got a brand new car We're playin the radio way too loud Wants me to grow to be some kind of cult star There's too much time for that right now    She's playin my very most favourite sweet record And her dad just loves my long brown hair He's buyin me a brand new leather jacket man! I dont remember what it was like to care
A Straight Line,   Yeah we're just watching history Now that the dogs are barking Take a picture for your children Make it real in FujiColor Life in the junkyard's hard Even when the dogs are sleeping But if you win you lose the next spin Madame monsieurs rien ne va plus    Wave goodbye to your innocence Sell it to the highest bidder In a tight spot call for assistance Is that American Express? Get me out of here 
All I'm Saying,   Kept you protected from things Did you ever think about it  Did you ever cry about it  Would you ever ever doubt it     I put my heart  With trust  Into your hands  One day changes come      We search endlessly  For answers to war and pain  We love the nights  Some days we laugh feel like it's alright 
Baby It's Alright,   Look at the mess I'm makin'  Look at that mess across your face (across your face)  As bitterness started showin'  Five years no-one hears just another night too scared to bleed     Give you some time to feel it;  I tangled you up in flesh and blood  Just to scared of where I took you  Spotlight blue to red crashin' in your head 
Breathe,   She got the future wrapped up inside her  Every day without her feels like a crime     Ow! Baby come closer whisper your secrets I'll tell you yours if you tell me mine  Well here comes the reason deep in your nature  We're creatures always trying to prove love     She got the future wrapped up inside her  Every day without her feels like a crime     She got the future wrapped up inside her  Every day without her feels like a crime  He wants to show her over and over  The way two people turn into one aow!
Don't Save Me from Myself,   I'm not keeping time get me outta here  Folding up my crimes ready for what's said to me  Does all that glitters shine? Love that new attraction  Animal inside leads me to the conclusion    I listen to the wind and mystery comes alive  Don't tie me up again separate love from possession  Does all that glitters shine? Love that new attraction  Animal inside leads me to the conclusion ugh! 
Fear,   I'm not preaching 'cause I'm full of sin  Nothing's secret that I have not done  Alone with your situation     Take the silver: I've paid that price  Here's the scandal   They don't let the truth get in the way  Alone with your situation     There are some things that we know will never change  Don't you worry don't you look away 
Flesh and Blood,   Trip away the bones and skin looking for what lies within  See the stars so cold above  Makes no sense of your flesh and blood  You walked the longest walk talked the toughest talk  You were outside something inside  Took away the words you want to hear again  You were outside something inside    Strip away the bones and skin show me what lies within  Would you be the one that I love?  Make no sense of your flesh and blood  You walked the longest walk talked the toughest talk  You were outside something inside  Took away the words you want to live again  You were outside something inside 
Get on the Inside,   I will never let your words be washed away  There are oceans to be named by you  Inside we lay in the shadows  Outside they push the skin parade   All the streets have turned from red to blue  It's probably gonna stay that way  Don't let me go and stop you  If you're looking for a better view    Are we gonna kill the things that mean the most  As a junkie is a jailer too  We're gonna recognize the faces  If we're searching for the life we blew   All the streets have turned from red to blue  It's probably gonna stay that way  Don't let me go and stop you  If you're looking for a better view    All you people talking so lonely  Making plans that your daddy wanted  Setting it up for the biggest falling  How you gonna learn learn to fake it?   Having trouble with the dirty make-up  Never gonna learn what you're running from  Acting like the world just owes you  Looking for love in all the wrong places
Let Me Show You,   This shattered town gets me down  My ticket's booked then you were found  I tore them up like you tore my heart  I'm black and blue from love and art  Who could take it? (Give it up gimme)     Well through the twilight how I've tried  To get my thoughts deep in your mind  In my sleep I've tasted you  Intoxicated by your every move  Who could take it? (Give it up gimme) 
Possibilities,   It's so strange  How my life's changed  I know nothing  About the people that I touched  Heard a story  It sounded easy  If you don't care     I'm so alive  If you told me  Nothing's perfect  Hearts are broken  Nothing's free    I will show you  Why it's worth it  And that's the way that it's meant to be  If you told me  Nothing's perfect   Hearts are broken  Nothing's free  I could show you  Why it's worth it  That's the way that it's meant to be  Heard a story  It sounded easy  Got a new skin and 
Put the Pieces Back Together,   Nothing gonna get me crying out for more  Seen nothing to seduce me Seen it all before  He's another leader Pretty head on the block  Got another axe to grind   If the dust ain't hard  Can he taste the money dripping off the tongue  All is fair in love and war  With a cold heart and a smoking gun     Every moment back together  In your quiet moments  Looking back in tears  Can I count the nights you've lived  That you'd live again  Looking for the real thing to even up the score  Finding out you're lonely  With an open door 
She Flirts for England,   She comes to the party on a kiss don't tell pony  And lets me have the first of her sighs  Tricks came so easy but you know she keeps your secrets  The tracks of the tears she will hide  Oh voices calling for the secrets we hide 
Slide Away,   Oh babe I don't wanna deal it  Oh make it alright  Gimme some my love  Away away away     I would catch you (Just couldn't let you go)  I'd catch you as you fall (Just couldn't let it go)  I would catch you (Just couldn't let you go)  I'd catch you if I heard your call  But you tore a hole in space Like a dark star falls from grace  You burn across the sky  And I would find you wings to fly  And I would catch you  I would catch your fall 
From the Morning,   A day once dawned And it was beautiful A day once dawned From the ground Then the night she fell And the air was beautiful The night she fell All around     And now we rise And we are everywhere And now we rise From the ground See she flies And she is everywhere See she flies All around
Parasite,   Lifting the mask from a local clown Feeling down like him Seeing the light in a station bar And travelling far in sin Sailing downstairs to the northern line Watching the shine of the shoes Hearing the trials of the people there Who's to care if they lose?     Dancing a jig in a church with chimes A sign of the times today Hearing no bell from the steeple tall People all in dismay Falling so far on a silver spoon Making the moon for fun Changing a robe for a size too small People all get hung 
Pink Moon,   I saw it written and I saw it say Pink moon is on its way And none of you stand so tall Pink moon gonna get ye all     I saw it written and I saw it say A pink moon is on its way And none of you stand so tall Pink moon gonna get ye all 
Place to Be,   When I was young younger than before I never saw the truth hanging from the door And now I'm older see it face to face And now I'm older gotta get up clean the place  And I was green greener than the hill Where flowers grew and the sun shone still Now I'm darker than the deepest sea Just hand me down give me a place to be  And I was strong strong in the sun I thought I'd see when day was done Now I'm weaker than the palest blue Oh so weak in this need for you
Road,   You can say the sun is shining if you really want to I can see the moon and it seems so clear 
Things Behind the Sun,   Please beware of them that stare They'll only smile to see you while your time away And once you've seen what they have been To win the earth just won't seem worth your night or your day Who'll hear what I say?     Look around you'll find the ground Is not so far from where you are but don't be too wise For down below they never grow They're always tired and charms are hired from out of their eyes Never a surprise     Don't be shy you learn to fly And see the sun when day is done if only you see Just what you are beneath a star That came to say one rainy day in autumn for free Yes be what you'll be
Which Will,   Which will you go for? Which will you love? Which will you choose from From the stars above? Which will you answer? Which will you call? Which will you take for For your one and all?     Which do you dance for? Which makes you shine? Which will you choose now If you won't choose mine? Which will you hope for? Which can it be? Which will you take now If you won't take me? 
(Baby) I can change my mind,   Aww she didn't bat an eye As I packed my bags to leave Thought she would start to cry Stood around on my room and grieve    As I took those steps Towards that open door Knowing all the time Oh Lord I just didn't wanna go  She didn't give me no sign Nothing that would make me change my mind Now I'd like to start all over again    Lord I played my games Many times before But peoples let me tell y'all Oh I never reached the door
Have a Little Faith,   Your best friend your best girl Just made a big mess o' your world 'Cause arm in arm they left you feelin' blue She set a trap you got caught You should a took her with a grain o' salt So have a little faith and love will come to you    Beyond the clouds the sky is always blue Have a little faith and love will come to you  So don't be lonely and don't be blue Your one and only is somewhere waitin' just for you With two lovin' arms to hug your neck Is right around the corner where you least expect She'll be there with love to pull you through Just have a little faith and love will come to you
Bagasas,   I leave behind the markets and the bazaars I want to run to the reeds and grasslands to become again a rider and sky come to take me again because I haven't been a trickster and I need your favor.    And I will create you songs with the most beautiful lines in the chorus. For my lost fight for which the stars remained alone crying  I leave behind the noise and the people I've had enough of wallops and I seek ways how to escape the fate and I have inside me a fl??d sky because I haven't been a trickster and you 'd want to flirt with me you light blue
I don't want you to cry my heart,   I hate the war and from the life I seek that not only the complaint in me remains and even if it was once that you had hugged me I know I'm asking you too much    I seek the war for a life in which I don't live so that not only the complaint in me remains and if it was only for once you to see my little wretch that I soften when you don't talk to me harshly  I hate the war and from the life I seek that not only the complaint in me remains and even if it was once that you had hugged me I know I'm asking you too much
Lina,   Your beloved one comes and goes how to find yourself? Doesn't worth as much as your life and death.  Tell me a lie to fall asleep. I pretend to be dumb only for you.    I no longer have time to explain to you. I finish difficultly with what I love.
All Apologies,   What else should I be? All apologies What else could I say? Everyone is gay What else could I write? I don't have the right What else should I be? All apologies     I wish I was like you Easily amused Find my nest of salt Everything is my fault I'll take all the blame Aqua seafoam shame Sunburn freezer burn Choking on the ashes of her enemy  
Dumb,   I'm not like them But I can pretend The sun is gone But I have a light The day is done But I'm having fun I think I'm dumb     My heart is broke But I have some glue Help me inhale And mend it with you We'll float around And hang out on clouds Then we'll come down     I'm not like them But I can pretend The sun is gone But I have a light The day is done But I'm having fun I think I'm dumb 
Heart-Shaped Box,   She eyes me like a Pisces when I am weak I've been locked inside your heart-shaped box for weeks I've been drawn into your magnet tar pit trap I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn back     Meat-eating orchids forgive no one just yet Cut myself on angel hair and baby's breath Broken hymen of 'Your Highness' I'm left black Throw down your umbilical noose so I can climb right back     She eyes me like a Pisces when I am weak I've been locked inside your heart-shaped box for weeks I've been drawn into your magnet tar pit trap I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black

Serve the Servants,   Teenage angst has paid off well Now I'm bored and old Self-appointed judges judge More than they absolve If she floats then she is not A witch like we have thought A downpayment on another One at Salem's lot     As my bones grew they did hurt They hurt really bad I tried hard to have a father But instead I had a dad I just want you to know that I Don't hate you anymore There is nothing I could say That I haven't thought before

Dirty Bird,   Remember when you where a flower so tender The day you arrived like a school girl Wanting to learn everything Your mother the baroness let you discover The ways of the world so he showed you And that's when he started to know you I'm talkin' the biblical sense    Fiction the decadent life of addiction Always the life of the party And everyone figured Bacardi But you were off cookin' the spoon
Down,   Another bridge I have burned A lesson I learned One more mistake to my cause One more hand got lost In a game So I was up for awhile Livin' in style Feelin' high on the hog    I had a similar dream of my dreams while I thought I had wandered a mile I was wrong
Dude,   Turn it up Tell me You're the girl who never goes away again Sell me On how the fairytale could never end Help me Find a happy ever after    Spare me All the rhetoric I've heard it all before Dare me But I'm not game to try it anymore Nearly Went postal when I figured out that
Matriarch,   Safe as can be To the eyes of adoration Simply starring back at me To say Everything in life is gonna be okay    I remember how the seats felt in her 225 And I can hear the engine purring as it pulls into the drive She'd pick me up and take me down to Dawn's five and ten And let me change my mind a thousand times And take me home again So cool Wrote me letters everyday when I was off at school
Rise,nan
She's the One,   Yeah Everything I ever wanted finally came to me But in the end it wasn't what I wanted it to be I wagered everything I had and never had a doubt Only to discover it ain't what it's all about I know I'm wrong Been gone too long I'm goin' home for good    Seems you always hurt the ones you really love the most Giving up the girl instead of giving up the ghost If I could do it all again I'd do it differently Cause everything that I did wrong is right in front of me I know it's time To make her mine I know my aim is true
The Hard Way,   Sellin' cigarettes and perfume To the hopeless and the strange I stumble through the mezzanine Neon lights and nicotine
Undone,   You took me outta circulation Well fate would agreed with the likes of me And handed me a sweet salvation Angel above come and set me free    Look at you in all your glory Take care of the breath that you take away Every picture tells a story The shape of things words cannot say
Chords Of Fame,   I found him by the stage last night -- he was breathing his last breath A bottle of wine and a cigarette was all that he had left I can see you make music 'cause you carry a guitar God help the troubadour who tries to be a star    I seen my share of hustlers as they try to take the world When they find their melody they're surrounded by the girls But it all fades so quickly like a sunny summer day Reporters ask you questions they write down what you say    They'll rob you of your innocence they will put you up for sale The more that you will find success the more that you will fail I been around I've had my share and I really can't complain But I wonder who I left behind the other side of fame
I Ain't Marching Anymore,   Oh I marched to the battle of New Orleans At the end of the early British war The young land started growing The young blood started flowing But I ain't marching anymore

Jaykub,   Jaykub It's time for you to wake up And accept your awards  Inside Your tiny little one room Apartment of the poor  Upon the podium You smile and you wave  They all thought that you were dumb But it's you who's on that stage    And never With anyone to talk to But the hero in your head  (The hero)  Upon the podium You're handsome and you're tall  But actually you are Just hardly 5 foot small
Just War,   Is this just war? Is this just war? The last survivor crawling through the dust And furthermore Will evolution diminish right in front of us  Late September I heard the siren call a truce But by December My head returned into the noose
Little Girl,   You get the point now You pick yourself up off the bar She's on his arm now Does it remind you of the pictures on the wall now? But you was young and I was not even born yet If you think I know a little more than The average person on the streets you are incorrect Because I'm ignorant as shit not here to preach man You know I just wanna have fun go to the beach man That's all I am I'm just a simple guy who talks when You put a microphone in front of him    Running left in a relationship Going in circles and I just can't wait Running left so we can get in shape Get in shape because we can't escape  Running left because I'm running late Ending up in the exact same place Running laps in your relationship Running away from the subtleties of  The world's always amazed at how much cash you made But not at how you made it it's just strange It sounded kind of cool over the phone It killed your neighbors and their dog and crushed their bones
Pain,   A massive headache in my aging skull Means I do not feel well    The problem started with my attitude It's all lust direct and crude There are good people in this world of bums But sadly I am not one    Pretty creepy pretty funny I'm a mix of god and monkey
Revenge,   Pain I guess it's a matter of sensation But somehow you have a way of avoiding it all In my mind I have shot you and stabbed you through your heart I just didn't understand the ricochet is the second part     Strange it seems like a character mutation Though I have all the means of bringing you fuckers down I can make myself to destroy upon command Somehow forgiveness lets the evil make the laws 
Star Eyes (I Can't Catch It),   Blue Sky Sun Shine Be Mine Star Eyes    Love Please Come Back Send You Cry Gone    Please Please Sun Shine Be Mine Come Back
The Man Who Played God,   Hammer it until it breaks To every shape that nature makes All things you can see around you You can change them Rearrange them in your mind    The girl becomes a bird on a flower In your state you feel your power All things you can see around you You can change them
Black Heart,   Black heart's coming he s a cold machine Cuts like a knife gentle and clean Face like an angel mind of a killer Nobody else going to love her better     Black heart's kicking like a beating drum Shooting her down the sound of his gun No compassion hard as an assassin Falling deeper still in that reckless fashion 
Cry cry,   Forgive the promise that is never kept The wasted life that you have left So sell your soul and put it on display Echoing the debts that cant be paid Breathe in let go The undertow Will pull you in and throw you out of time The shadows playing tricks on your broken mind Tears will not cure the pain     Yesterday is lost again Collect the hours suffering in vein So hold on tight watch the embers glow The ashes fly away out of your control Breath in let go The undertow Will pull you in and throw you out of time The shadows playing tricks on your broken mind Tears will not cure the pain  
Out of time,   Longing is the animal inside you when you bleed Suffering is critical in finding what you need Deliverance is evidence theres more than what you say Pain is there the moment that you wake up from your dreams     Loneliness is beautiful it leads you home again Happiness is overrated joy is infinite Liberate the hate you feel before its permanent Smile when it hurts it works like mothers medicine 
Same On The Inside,   Sending out a message to the world But I just can't seem to find the words No one wants to die alone Broken and insane Question every last decision Another empty page     Wanting what I know won't satisfy Just to live this need to live a lie Never meant to run away Jumping out the train My cage was built on good intentions Running every page 
Tomorrow,   These endless days are wait for me Tearing my heart that breaks for you I'm coming home tomorrow Though you're not lying next to me I hear your song that calls to me I'm coming home tomorrow Back in your arms     The summer's gone and I can see The season's end is set me free I'm coming home tomorrow Back in your arms 
Merry-go-round,   If you ain't got two kids by 21 You're probably gonna die alone. Least that's what tradition told you. And it don't matter if you don't believe Come Sunday morning you best be there in the front row like you're supposed to.    We think the first time's good enough. So we hold on to high school love. Sayin' we won't end up like our parents. Tiny little boxes in a row. Ain't what you want it's what you know. Just happy in the shoes you're wearin'. Same checks we're always cashin' to buy a little more distraction.
Learn to Row,   You could smell the sea on his working clothes  I'd take his rough hands and I wouldn't let go  Son if ships don't sail then our table's bare    We are cast adrift on an endless storm  Many dreams will come and wash overboard  But we will not mourn what we have not lost  We will learn to row with the oars  We have got     On an endless storm (On the storm)  Many dreams will come and wash overboard (Many dreams)  But we will not mourn (We will not mourn)  What we have not lost 
Old Country Country,   Back on the coast of Wales to trace my people  I came upon a tombstone with my name  And as I lay down my rose  I knew I was not alone  Red hair and green eyes were watchin' me  She took me to her home to play her sweet music  And sitting by her fire I took her in  She was singin' soft and low  I heard an echo in my soul  Like something I had left here a long time ago
Private Battlefield,   Hanging here on your barbed wire  In surrender to the cause of your desire   If making love is making war  I wonder who I'm fighting for     There's no use in me pretending I'm not scared  You caught me cold and unaware  But I pray someday that peace may reign  On our private battlefield   If making love is making war  I wonder who I'm fighting for  But my wounds will heal on our private battlefield  I thought that you were on my side  Now I need a place to hide 
Shattered Cross,   Your life won't amount to a bottle of smoke  No you never make deals with a guy named doc   Don't bring me your tales of temptation and loss  The rags of your dreams your shattered cross 
Simple Man,   I hear the whispers behind my back  I'm trying hard but things look black   I'm a simple man had a simple plan  I got a complicated life     That lets a simple man lead a complicated life  I take one step forward it's like two steps back  I may be weary but my soul's intact  Forever chasing what I can't reach  Forever pacing life's stony beach 
Supernatural,    I'm a snake handler from the mountains  Sing them rattlers off to sleep yeah  Ooh if my baby she needs healing  No fever too hot no cut too deep  Go with you anyway the wind blows  Straight through the fire into the unknown  Follow the feelings 'cause I know      I'm a rain maker in the desert  Dance and I coax those clouds to cry  Put the bloom back in baby's meadow  And I I flood the faith flood the faith back into your eyes  Go with you anyway the wind blows  Straight through the fire into the unknown  Follow the feelings 'cause I know 
Too Many Ghosts,   Time to pay the piper time to call in a marker  Time to cough it up  The last thing on my mind  Was another shot at love       I left them off at a bus stop  Along the coast   You brushed past from nowhere  And you sat right up front with me    Forgiveness or forgetfulness  It's all the same to me   And as I stare into her eyes  And press her in my arms  I look over her shoulder  And there my demons are
Toujour Aimez,"   We bought some chocolates and some cheap champagne  And caught a taxi in the pouring rain I told her that I loved her long tan legs  She looked confused and said ""bien sûr"" ...and offered me a cigarette      Woke up alone; a note beside my head  And perfume samples scattered round my bed "
End of Your World,   Dares to make a sound  I said well ain't that the way  That you like it   Well I know with all the plans we had it was gonna be hard to succeed  But harder than any of that is sitting here watching you bleed  
Following My Own Tracks,   I don't think I wanna know   It's over-said but understated just how hard it can be  Hey I think I've seen this road before  And it's so hard to believe  I'd be back this way again after I told myself to leave   You never said that it was gonna be easy  But I didn't know just how hard it would be    But if you do it well  You can find heaven if you can handle hell  It's all part of understanding just how strange life can be  Living a lie becomes so easy but now 
Hollow Log,    He loves the city lights the circus and the sound  He loves the buildings and the holes in the ground  He plays and bounces 'round until he sees  The moon go down  Then back home again he hops  
Pass the Flagon,   It don't taste bad for such cheap wine  And now the only thing left to forget  Is that picture of her   Well I awake and everything's bright  Oh my eyes they can't adjust  To the morning light 
Shining,   I can see it shinin'  It's coming for me comin' out of the night  Everything is hummin' it's scarin' me now  It ain't feelin' right   Think I might just hide a while wait for the night to return  Dark and cold and lonely  Is how I feel and it feels nice  Don't want any company it just wouldn't feel right   I used to be so happy I could smile  And everything seemed to work out  Now my eyes are starting to close down  I can see you again in my dreams  You're starring my lost and lonely friend  We used to have such good times  Why did you leave before our time was through?   Everything looks pretty we're far from the city  And I'm holding you in my arms  You feel so alive and so do I 
You don't even know my name,   You know I follow you  Wherever you go  Hoping one day  Things might change
I Love You,nan

Köle,"    A long time ago You entraped me There is no else way for me  You or nothing You or nothing  I sometimes looked for a path to me There is always blues in my hand It's very difficult to be afraid of losing you You or nothing You or nothing  I became a slave to your love I became a slave to your love I became a slave to your love I became a slave to your love    What does a man want in his life? Some kindnesssome passion that's all The only thing you can give me in this life ""Let's do itlet's do it""  I became a slave to your love..."
Oyuncak Dünya,   Toy world toy world...  This game is very easyyou play it too.. Break and pourmake and ruin... Start again... We are all children actually..     Some children never get calm  They always be the party-pooper... They constantly made other children sad..  The rules of the game always ruined...  
Sadece Senin Olmak,     My love for you is an everflowing water  Tell me do you feel like this too?  There is nothing else on my mind  Other than you nowadays  Only your love consoles me  It makes me forget all my troubles  Tonight hold me in your caring arms     Tonight being on your mind is not enough for me  I want to be near you  Tonight being in your dreams is not enough for me  I want to be in your bed  I want to be in your bed  
Yasamak Istemem,    Everything that I've been taught  Everything that I've been suggested  The life that is imposed on me  Is a useless trash   Systems you have created  Methods you have used     Maybe I'm the one upside-down  I couldn't make it in this order  I've started to look for a place to hide  In the city of reptiles  Educated dogs  Voracious monkeys
