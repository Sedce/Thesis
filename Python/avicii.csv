avicii,Friend of Mine,"  Hey Do you remember we said ""Hello""? And you asked me about my Levi's T-shirt Said ""You are a friend of mine"" My oh my You must have saved me about a thousand times I wouldn't be the one I am today If you hadn't been a friend of mine    Hey Hey hey hey hey I haven't seen you around since high school How you doin' do you still remember me? Are you still a friend of mine? Guess you're still a friend of mine Guess you're still a friend of mine Now I see I see Why I get nervous when you look at me It's like your eyes are trying to tell me something That you're more than just a friend of mine That you're more than just a friend of mine oh my ",  I ain't misbehaving I'm just telling you the truth Take my love for granted Yeah I'll give it all to you Made me count for something Yeah I feel it in my heart God only knows what I'd have been if you hadn't been    I ain't misbehaving I'm just telling you the truth Take my love for granted Yeah I'll give it all to you Made me count for something Yeah I feel it in my heart God only knows what I'd have been if you hadn't been

avicii,Lonely Together,  It's you and your world and I'm caught in the middle I caught the edge of a knife and it hurts just a little And I know and I know and I know and I know that I can't be your friend It's my head or my heart and I'm caught in the middle     Eyes wide shut and it feels like the first time Before the rush to my blood was too much and we flatlined And I know and I know and I know and I know just how this ends Now I'm all messed up and it feels like the first time ,  I might hate myself tomorrow But I'm on my way tonight At the bottom of a bottle You're the poison in the wine And I know I can't change you and I I won't change I might hate myself tomorrow But I'm on my way tonight     I might hate myself tomorrow But I'm on my way tonight At the bottom of a bottle You're the poison in the wine And I know I can't change you and I I won't change I might hate myself tomorrow But I'm on my way tonight    I might hate myself tomorrow But I'm on my way tonight At the bottom of a bottle You're the poison in the wine And I know I can't change you and I I won't change I might hate myself tomorrow But I'm on my way tonight

avicii,So Much Better (Avicii Remix),  I tried my best that I could do Just to find out I was never yours I hang on to the words that you said And I held out when my world was lost    I tried my best that I could do Just to find out I was never yours I hang on to the words that you said And I held out when my world was lost ,  'Cause I can do so Yeah I can do so Yeah I can do so much better I can do so I can do so I can do so much better    Cause I can do so Yeah I can do so Yeah I can do so much better I can do so I can do so I can do so much better    Cause I can do so Yeah I can do so Yeah I can do so much better I can do so I can do so I can do so much better

avicii,What Would I Change It To,  Steady yourself even though you know that you're falling Maybe you're falling but you're still alive Ready yourself that's quite enough of your bawlin' 'Cause baby you're bawling but you'll survive Ooh ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh    You can copy and paste your head on a new body But that new body's still made of flesh And cutting corners gets you where you're going But how you get there is the real test ,  Forever trading places with the same old me I'm racking up the cases of who I failed to be Why would I replace the sky? Why would I recreate that perfect blue? What would I change it to? Oh won't you tell me What would I change it to? Oh won't you tell me What would I change it to?    Forever trading places with the same old me I'm racking up the cases of who I failed to be Why would I replace the sky? Why would I recreate that perfect blue? What would I change it to? Oh won't you tell me What would I change it to? Oh won't you tell me What would I change it to?

avicii,Without You,  You said that we would always be Without you I feel lost at sea Through the darkness you'd hide with me Like the wind we'd be wild and free    Now I'm running away my dear From myself and the truth I fear My heart is beating I can't see clear How I'm wishing that you were here ,  I've gotta learn how to love without you I've gotta carry my cross without you Stuck in the middle and I'm just about to Figure it out without you And I'm done sitting home without you Fuck I'm going out without you I'm gonna to tear this city down without you I'm goin' Bonnie and Clyde without you    I've gotta learn how to love without you I've gotta carry my cross without you Stuck in the middle and I'm just about to Figure it out without you And I'm done sitting home without you Fuck I'm going out without you I'm gonna to tear this city down without you I'm goin' Bonnie and Clyde without you

avicii,You Be Love,  You can be the potter I'll be the clay You can be the blacksmith And I'll be the blade You can be the poet And I'll be the song You can be the sunlight And I'll be the dawn    I will be your compass If you'll be my north I will be your sailor If you'll be my shore You can be the gravity I'll be the fall You can be my everything And I'll be your all ,  You Be Love I will be your lover (I'll be your lover) I will be your lover (I'll be your lover) You Be Love I will be your lover (I'll be your lover) Love you like no other (I'll be your lover)    You Be Love I will be your lover (I'll be your lover) I will be your lover (I'll be your lover) You Be Love I will be your lover (I'll be your lover) Love you like no other (I'll be your lover)    You Be Love I will be your lover (I'll be your lover) I will be your lover (I'll be your lover) You Be Love I will be your lover (I'll be your lover) Love you like no other (I'll be your lover)
