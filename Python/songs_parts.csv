Nick Drake,Place to Be,[verse] When I was young younger than before I never saw the truth hanging from the door And now I'm older see it face to face And now I'm older gotta get up clean the place  And I was green greener than the hill Where flowers grew and the sun shone still Now I'm darker than the deepest sea Just hand me down give me a place to be  And I was strong strong in the sun I thought I'd see when day was done Now I'm weaker than the palest blue Oh so weak in this need for you,,,,

Nick Traina,Better Than Shit,[verse] Why do you think that you can save me if I can't even save myself? you condemn me for my actions; just take a look at yourself hellbent on destruction in everything you do I don't even know the truth so why not lie to you. All of your persistence will on ly wast your time if I'm still alive tomorrow than I promise I'll be fine. Remind me to forget you I think it's for the best you said that you were different but you're just like all the rest of all the hypocritesand the bullsh*t they're about.

A nd you can tell me what you want you can scream or even cry but if it passes through your leps I'm gonna know that it's a lie. Suppression creates depression so let your thought flow free just open up your mind and I promise you will see.

Nick Traina,No Such Thing,[verse] No such thing as safety there's nowhere you can run the world is filled with hatred and they streets are filled with blood. Home is just a prison a furnished prison cell then you walk outside the door into a living hell. No such thing as safety there's nowhere you can hide don't think you can change a thing so why bother to try. Walk down these streets and remember how they used to be now those times are long gone and that joy is just a memory. No such thing as safety nobody's ever free no one ever gets it all except for Jeff Ott and now I'm looking out over the east bay and all my problems seem so far away. In thsoe streets I stumble over cracked concrete running in circles on tired feet. I'm sick of all this hatred it does no one no good if I could change the world you fucking bet I would. We are the new school its up to us to change the way things are to make things better. Fuck separatism we have to unite at all costs. Unconditional acceptance of people into our lives and scenes is the only way. Race age sex religion what you wear what music you like who you fuck... none of it matters. The adult society infested with snobbery and violence should bear no reflection on our underground. Instead of turning our backs to the new kids wanting to learn about our scenes we should teach them how it should be. Nobody was born cool and nobody is better than the rest. We can do it all we have to do is try... otherwise the cycle will continue and we too will get caught in it just like so many of those who came before us. There are too many boundaries too many walls too many locked hearts and too many closed minds. It's up to us to cross the boundaries to break the walls to unlock the hearts and to open the minds,,,,

We've listened to you b*tch about this world gone wrong but you can only sit bitch and do nothing for so long. Watch it all fall down around you while you sit safe at home we're packing up and moving on and you'll be left alone. The carefree world that used to be has fallen out of sight I want to take it back but it's going to be a fight. When you leave this earth your beliefs leave too I don't want to achieve nothing and go out like a fool. The way I like to see it is it's them against us. We've got youth on our side let's f*ck sh*t up. Every time they've stopped you from doing what you must every teacher cop and parent that's dragged you through the mud I refuse to allow it and I hope there's more like me.

Same trailer different park.,[chorus] Mama's hooked on Mary Kay. Brother's hooked on Mary Jane. Daddy's hooked on Mary two doors down. Mary Mary quite contrary.

This merry go 'round. [verse] We think the first time's good enough. So we hold on to high school love. Sayin' we won't end up like our parents. Tiny little boxes in a row.

Brother's hooked on Mary Jane. Daddy's hooked on Mary two doors down. Mary Mary quite contrary. We get bored so we get married. Just like dust we settle in this town. On this broken merry go 'round and 'round and 'round we go Where it stops nobody knows and it ain't slowin' down. This merry go 'round. [outro] Mary Mary quite contrary. We're so bored until we're buried. Just like dust we settle in this town. On this broken merry go 'round. Merry go 'round.  Jack and Jill went up the hill. Jack burned out on booze and pills. And Mary had a little lamb. Mary just don't give a damn no more.,,,
