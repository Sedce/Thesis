Eminem,Rap God,"[verse] But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes I got a laptop in my back pocket My pen'll go off when I half-cock it Got a fat knot from that rap profit Made a livin' and a killin' off it Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack I'm an MC still as honest But as rude and as indecent as all hell Syllables skill-a-holic (kill 'em all with) This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match With this rappity brat packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac' Backpack rap crap yap-yap yackety-yack And at the exact same time I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half Only realized it was ironic I was signed to Aftermath after the fact How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs Feel my wrath of attack Rappers are havin' a rough time period here's a maxi pad It's actually disastrously bad for the wack While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpièce  [verse] Well to be truthful the blueprint's Simply rage and youthful exuberance Everybody loves to root for a nuisance Hit the Earth like an asteroid Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!) MC's get taken to school with this music 'Cause I use it as a vehicle to ""bust a rhyme"" Now I lead a new school full of students Me?

Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad) Uh summa-lumma dooma-lumma you assumin' I'm a human What I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and I'm devastating more than ever demonstrating How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating Never fading and I know the haters are forever waiting For the day that they can say I fell off they'll be celebrating 'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated I make elevating music you make elevator music ""Oh he's too mainstream."" Well that's what they do when they get jealous they confuse it ""It's not hip-hop it's pop"" – 'cause I found a hella way to fuse it With rock shock rap with Doc Throw on ""Lose Yourself"" and make 'em lose it ""I don't know how to make songs like that I don't know what words to use.""

But if I can't batter the women How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then? Don't mistake him for (Satan); it's a fatal mistake If you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation To trip a broad and make her fall on her face and Don't be a retard – be a king?
