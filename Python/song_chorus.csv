I Ain't Marching Anymore,  For I've killed my share of Indians In a thousand different fights I was there at the Little Big Horn I heard many men lying I saw many more dying But I ain't marching anymore   For I stole California from the Mexican land Fought in the bloody Civil War Yes I even killed my brothers And so many others But I ain't marching anymore  For I marched to the battles of the German trench In a war that was bound to end all wars Oh I must have killed a million men And now they want me back again But I ain't marching anymore     It's always the old to lead us to the war It's always the young to fall Now look at all we've won with the saber and the gun Tell me is it worth it all   For I flew the final mission in the Japanese sky Set off the mighty mushroom roar When I saw the cities burning I knew that I was learning That I ain't marching anymore

Learn to Row,  And I'm not alone out there  Got to grow up fast when you don't have a choice  When the table's bare and there's no father's voice  Smell his working clothes on the cold salt air  And I'm not alone out there  No I'm not alone out there    And we're not alone out there  We are not alone out there   We are cast adrift on an endless storm  Many dreams will come and wash overboard  But we will not mourn what we have not lost  We will learn to row with the oars  We are cast adrift (We cast adrift)
