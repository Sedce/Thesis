Music is the healing force of the universe,
Music of love,
Music is the spirit,
Music is life,
Life is music,
Music is played, listened to, danced to,
Sometimes not understood but felt,
Music causes all bad vibrations to fade away,
It makes one want to love instead of hate,
It puts the mind in a healthy state of thought.
It reconciles, unites, becomes oneness,
It brings about a state of wholeness and purifies,
Oh, let it come in,
Oh, let it come in,
The music of the universe,
The music of love,
Be healed.
Music is the healing force of the universe,
Music of love,
Music is giving,
Music is greatness,
It's never complete, it is a being,
It's always there,
To feel,
> To let in,
> To become obsessed by,
> To be healed by,
> So open up your door,
> And let it come in,
> Let it into the very interior of your soul,
> Sometime our very soul is in need of spiritual medication,
> We do not always need the pill and its contents,
> Just open up your heart and soul and let it come in,
> Oh, let it come in,
> Oh, let it come in,
> The music of the universe,
> The music of love,
> Be healed.
> Oh, let it come in,
> Oh, let it come in,
> The music of the universe,
> The music of love,
> Be healed.
