[verse]
I saw it written and I saw it say
Pink moon is on its way
And none of you stand so tall
Pink moon gonna get ye all

[chorus]
It's a pink moon
Yes, a pink moon

[bridge]
Pink, pink, pink, pink
Pink moon
A pink, pink, pink, pink
Pink moon

[verse]
I saw it written and I saw it say
A pink moon is on its way
And none of you stand so tall
Pink moon gonna get ye all

[chorus]
It's a pink moon
Yes, a pink moon
