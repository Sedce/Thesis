[verse]
You can say the sun is shining if you really want to
I can see the moon and it seems so clear

[chorus]
You can take the road that takes you to the stars now
I can take a road that'll see me through
I can take a road that'll see me through

[chorus]
You can take the road that takes you to the stars now
I can take a road that'll see me through
I can take a road that'll see me through
I can take a road that'll see me through
