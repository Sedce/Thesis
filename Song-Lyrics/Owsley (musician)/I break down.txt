[verse]
I try to go on, I try to be strong
I try to be the one to stand tall
I try to impress you, try to make you think
Nothing can hurt me, I can take it all
When the sky turns grey and the clouds bring thunder
I hold up a shelter for you to hide under
When the rain begins to fall and my shelter hits the ground
Then I'm the one

[chorus]
I break down
[verse]
They say in the world to make it
You've got to be strong
Day after day gets harder

To hold on
But sometimes I get sad
And my smiles turn to frowns, then it's my turn

[chorus]
To break down
[verse]
When you reach out and cry to me
I hold on, internally
But sometimes I get sad
And my smiles turn to frowns, then I'm the one
[chorus]
I break down
