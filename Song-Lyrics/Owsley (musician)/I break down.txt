I try to go on, I try to be strong
I try to be the one to stand tall
I try to impress you, try to make you think
Nothing can hurt me, I can take it all
When the sky turns grey and the clouds bring thunder
I hold up a shelter for you to hide under
When the rain begins to fall and my shelter hits the ground
Then I'm the one

Chorus:
I break down

They say in the world to make it
You've got to be strong
Day after day gets harder

To hold on
But sometimes I get sad
And my smiles turn to frowns, then it's my turn

Chorus:
To break down

When you reach out and cry to me
I hold on, internally
But sometimes I get sad
And my smiles turn to frowns, then I'm the one
 

Chorus:
I break down
