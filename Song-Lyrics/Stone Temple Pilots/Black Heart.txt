[verse]
Black heart's coming, he ’s a cold machine
Cuts like a knife, gentle and clean
Face like an angel, mind of a killer
Nobody else going to love her better

[bridge]
Lay down now stay down
Took her life with a quick pull trigger

[chorus]
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Well I don't mind, I don't mind
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Said I don't mind if you don't mind
The color is all but faded
Out of a dead man's eyes
Down to his blackened heart

[verse]
Black heart's kicking like a beating drum
Shooting her down the sound of his gun
No compassion, hard as an assassin
Falling deeper still in that reckless fashion

[bridge]
Lay down now stay down
Deeper and deeper with a blind man's passion
 

[chorus]
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Well I don’t mind, I don’t mind
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Said I don’t mind if you don’t mind
The color is all but faded
Out of a dead man's eyes
Down to his blackened heart

[bridge]
Rescue me
(If you don’t mind)
Rescue me
(If you don’t mind)
Rescue me
(If you don’t mind)

[chorus]
If you don't mind
The color is all but faded
Out of a dead man's eyes
Down to his blackened heart
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
