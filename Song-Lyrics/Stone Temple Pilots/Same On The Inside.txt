[verse]
Sending out a message to the world
But I just can't seem to find the words
No one wants to die alone
Broken and insane
Question every last decision
Another empty page

[chorus]
Do you know the answers?
Tell me, I find my happy ending
When do we start pretending that
We're all the same on the inside

[verse]
Wanting what I know won't satisfy
Just to live this, need to live a lie
Never meant to run away
Jumping out the train
My cage was built on good intentions
Running every page

[chorus]
Do you know the answers?
Tell me, I find my happy ending
When do we start pretending that
We're all the same on the inside
[bridge]
All the same on the inside
All the same on the inside

[chorus]
All the same on the inside

[outro]
All the same on the inside
We're all the same on the inside [x2]
Yeah, we're all the same on the inside
