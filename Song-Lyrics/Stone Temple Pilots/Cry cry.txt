[verse]
Forgive the promise that is never kept
The wasted life that you have left
So sell your soul and put it on display
Echoing the debts that can’t be paid
Breathe in let go
The undertow
Will pull you in and throw you out of time
The shadow’s playing tricks on your broken mind
Tears will not cure the pain

[chorus]
Cry cry, can’t say no
Nothing cures a craving
Yeah yeah
Cry cry it’s all a show
Just a game you’re playing
Yeah yeah yeah

[verse]
Yesterday is lost again
Collect the hours suffering in vein
So hold on tight watch the embers glow
The ashes fly away out of your control
Breath in let go
The undertow
Will pull you in and throw you out of time
The shadow’s playing tricks on your broken mind
Tears will not cure the pain
 

[chorus]
Cry cry, can’t say no
Nothing cures a craving
Yeah yeah
Cry cry it’s all a show
Just a game you’re playing
Yeah yeah yeah
Cry cry, can’t say no
Nothing cures a craving
Yeah yeah
Cry cry it’s all a show
Just a game you’re playing
Yeah yeah yeah

[outro]
Cry cry, can’t say no
Nothing cures a craving
Yeah yeah
Cry cry it’s all a show
Just a game you’re playing
Yeah yeah
