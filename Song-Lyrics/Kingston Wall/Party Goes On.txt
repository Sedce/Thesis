[intro]
Yesterday was such a fine day for me to live
Yesterday everything was in my head in one peace
I had my time to lie down and just to wonder 'round
I had my time to go into the system of sounds
And I think it over
[bridge]
No one can keep this time from running out
No one can keep this time from running out
It's meant to be tasted, the party goes on
[verse]
One day I'll finish everything that I have begun
One day I'll explain, h yes, and you will understand
Work now and rest later, rest now and work later on?
One day is someday but now I will have to go on
Before it's over
[chorus]
"Life is a party isn't it my friend
Or what do you think?
Are we here just fooling each other or
Are we giving good entertainment for each other
What do you think ?

It's a big, big, big adventure and it's getting to be so
Groovy, just lay it all out
It's all there you know, it's hiding inside of you and if
You are keeping it hidden there...or what do you think
 

And we're all in it together so don't spoil it with your
Stupid atmosphere..
And you're the only one* to blame you know
.. or what do you think .... or do you stink?"

In the mirrorland

The word is the game and the game is the word
The word is the sword to make the worlds law
[outro]
The s in the word makes the word a sword
And the S in the sword makes the world fall

The word with the s makes the wordsorder
To use the wordsword in the s-order

The L in the word makes the worldsorder
Cauze the L is the law from the wordholder

The law of the s makes the word a sword
The sword without the s makes the worldwar
