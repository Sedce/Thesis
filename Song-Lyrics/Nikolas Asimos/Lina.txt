[intro]
Lina, Lina, don't be sad
Lina, Lina, don't be afraid
Lina, Lina, how do you sleep alone, damn?
[verse]
Your beloved one comes and goes
how to find yourself?
Doesn't worth as much as
your life and death.
 
Tell me a lie
to fall asleep.
I pretend to be dumb
only for you.
[chorus]
Lina, Lina, goldfinch
I will see you next month
you've locked me in the kitchen
and you became a ballerina.
 
Lina, Lina, we live apart
I have worked in the ships too
Lina, Lina, did your other boys
have such strains?
[verse]
I no longer have time
to explain to you.
I finish difficultly
with what I love.
[chorus]
Lina, Lina, when I saw you
I felt like a flagship
and you broke like a storm
in flaura and fauna.
 [verse]
Now you say that I belonged to you
but I didn't pay the IKA
It would be pompous
if they registered me.
 
Tell me a lie
to fall asleep.
I pretend to be dumb
only for you.
[chorus]
Lina, Lina, even if I am losing you,
I won' t trouble you again,
like the dog with the cat
is our love on the road.
[outro]
Lina, Lina, I kickstart
and bring all the hidden things forth,
you have a serpentine beauty,
what are you doing in Patisia?
