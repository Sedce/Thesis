Lina, Lina, don't be sad
Lina, Lina, don't be afraid
Lina, Lina, how do you sleep alone, damn?
 
Your beloved one comes and goes
how to find yourself?
Doesn't worth as much as
your life and death.
 
Tell me a lie
to fall asleep.
I pretend to be dumb
only for you.
 
Lina, Lina, goldfinch
I will see you next month
you've locked me in the kitchen
and you became a ballerina.
 
Lina, Lina, we live apart
I have worked in the ships too
Lina, Lina, did your other boys
have such strains?
 
I no longer have time
to explain to you.
I finish difficultly
with what I love.
 
Lina, Lina, when I saw you
I felt like a flagship
and you broke like a storm
in flaura and fauna.
 
Now you say that I belonged to you
but I didn't pay the IKA
It would be pompous
if they registered me.
 
Tell me a lie
to fall asleep.
I pretend to be dumb
only for you.
 
Lina, Lina, even if I am losing you,
I won' t trouble you again,
like the dog with the cat
is our love on the road.
 
Lina, Lina, I kickstart
and bring all the hidden things forth,
you have a serpentine beauty,
what are you doing in Patisia?
