[chorus]
I don't want you to cry, my heart, for what we went through yesterday,
much has been destroyed but find a path again,
the people don't know how to live, get down to go on foot,
where everyone asks to find his talk again
[verse]
I hate the war and from the life I seek,
that not only the complaint in me remains
and even if it was once that you had hugged me,
I know I'm asking you too much
[chorus] 
I don't want you to cry, my heart, for what we went through yesterday,
borrow, you too, once and find a path again
and if you lose what makes you live it was not only your fault,
they deserve to live as kids those who have a heart
[verse]
I seek the war for a life in which I don't live,
so that not only the complaint in me remains
and if it was only for once you to see, my little wretch,
that I soften when you don't talk to me harshly
 
I hate the war and from the life I seek,
that not only the complaint in me remains
and even if it was once that you had hugged me,
I know I'm asking you too much
