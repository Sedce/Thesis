I leave behind the markets and the bazaars
I want to run to the reeds and grasslands
to become again a rider
and sky, come to take me again
because I haven't been a trickster
and I need your favor.
 
Mpagasa! Do you enjoy it there above,
I seek for a breath to recover
I don't believe that you make fun of me
as I'm looking at you, you don't notice it
Recommend me any sollution
it will not cost you much
 
And I will create you songs
with the most beautiful lines in the chorus.
For my lost fight
for which the stars remained alone crying
 
I leave behind the noise and the people
I've had enough of wallops and I seek ways
how to escape the fate
and I have inside me a fl??d, sky,
because I haven't been a trickster
and you 'd want to flirt with me, you light blue
 
Mpagasa! Do you enjoy it there above,
Take a look also on the ground
when you sleep and and sail
suddenly you sparkle and make thunders
and whatever you think of you bring it down
do not think that you 're agitating me.
 
Because I create you songs
with the most beautiful lines in the chorus.
For my lost fight
for which the stars remained alone crying
