[intro]
It's a terrible thing to lose

All the time you've had and never used

Sometimes you wanna hide

And sometimes you wanna light the fuse

[verse]

And you know just where you stand

But it's hard to make the plan

When all that you do is wrong

And no one to find a song to play


[chorus]

Three time loser

White line user

Mr. Groover

Where's it end?


And there's nothing that you can say

You can make it most any day

And if you try very hard

You know you might find a yard or two


Three time loser

White line user

Mr. Groover

Where's it end?


And there's nothing that you can say

You can make it most any day

And if you try very hard

You know you might find a yard or two



[bridge]
Sometimes you wanna hide

Sometimes you wanna light the fuse
