[intro]
Know you can know you can

Know you can know you can
[verse]
Wrapped up in a rock 'n' roll contract

Lots of things I had to sign at the time

Man told me not to worry 'bout the business

Just keep on poppin' those hits

[chorus]
Know you can, know you can

Know you can, know you can

[verse]
Sat down in my pyramid mansion

Old Martin seems to know all the chords

Tired of beggin', I can make it without them

Played the blues so I wouldn'­t get bored

[bridge]
You made me your slave. Whatever God gave me

You took to the grave, now it'­s gone

I gave you my heart. Whatever God gave me

You took to the grave, now it'­s gone

Yeah, it'­s gone

[outro]
Gone
Smokin', chokin', drinkin', sinkin', falling over

Cokin', flyin', speedin', dyin', roll me over

Roll me over (wrapped up in a rock 'n' roll contract)

Roll me over (wrapped up in a rock 'n' roll contract)

Know you can know you can

Know you can know you can
