[intro]
Many times you've never known the way it feels

Many times you never let it show

All the people all around never telling nobody

All the people all around never telling a soul


[chorus]
So, come on, let me hold you tight

So, come on, be with you all night

So come on, let me hold you, hold you

Come on


[verse]
Many times we've been so out of tune with it

Many times we've never known the way

All the people all around never telling nobody

All the people all around never telling a soul

[chorus]
So, come on, let me hold you tight

So, come on, be with you all night

So come on, let me hold you, hold you

Come on

[bridge]

Show me your magic and our love will be around

Now that it's just we two, don't you let me die


[verse]
Many times we've been so out of tune with it

Many times we've never let it show

All the people all around never telling nobody

All the people all around never telling a soul

[outro]
So, come on, let me hold you tight

So, come on, be with you all night, so come on

Let me hold you, hold you, come on

Let me hold you tight, so, come on

Be with you all night, so come on

Let me hold you, hold you, come on

Let me hold you, hold you, come on

Let me hold you, hold you, come on!
