[intro]
No one knows it
No one knows it
No one knows it, no
No one knows how good I feel
When I see you glow
[chorus]
No one knows it
No one knows it
No one knows it, no
No one knows how good I feel
When you let it show
[verse]
Keep it coming, keep it long
Caress me with your body song
Reach it higher with each sigh
Knowing soon that we will fly
[chorus]
No one knows it
No one knows it
No one knows it, no
No one knows how good I feel
When I see you glow

No one knows it
No one knows it
No one knows it, no
No one knows how good I feel
When you let it flow
 
[verse]
Keep it moving, keep it bright
And guide me with your body light
Come in closer with each sigh
Knowing soon that we will fly
[chorus]
No one knows
No one knows
No one knows
No one knows how good I feel
When you let it show
No one knows
No one knows how good I feel
When you let it flow.)
[verse]
Keep on feeling, keep it whole
And lead me with your body soul
Take me higher with each sigh
Knowing you can make me fly
[outro]
No one knows it
No one knows it
No one knows it, no
No one knows how good I feel
When I see you glow
