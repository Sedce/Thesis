No one knows it
No one knows it
No one knows it, no
No one knows how good I feel
When I see you glow

No one knows it
No one knows it
No one knows it, no
No one knows how good I feel
When you let it show

Keep it coming, keep it long
Caress me with your body song
Reach it higher with each sigh
Knowing soon that we will fly

No one knows it
No one knows it
No one knows it, no
No one knows how good I feel
When I see you glow

No one knows it
No one knows it
No one knows it, no
No one knows how good I feel
When you let it flow
 

Keep it moving, keep it bright
And guide me with your body light
Come in closer with each sigh
Knowing soon that we will fly

(Mika's Japanese cooing over guitar solo (Pete Ham):
No one knows
No one knows
No one knows
No one knows how good I feel
When you let it show
No one knows
No one knows how good I feel
When you let it flow.)

Keep on feeling, keep it whole
And lead me with your body soul
Take me higher with each sigh
Knowing you can make me fly

No one knows it
No one knows it
No one knows it, no
No one knows how good I feel
When I see you glow
