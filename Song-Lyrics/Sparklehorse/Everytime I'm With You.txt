[intro]
Every time I'm with you
I am drunk
And you are too
Well what the hell
[verse]
Else are we
Supposed to do
Yeah every time
You come by

We get so trashed
And stay up all night
[bridge]
Well it's so wrong
But it's so right
Yeah, it's alright
[chorus]
Every time, Every time
Every time, Every time
Every time, Every time
I'm with you
I guess it's true
[chorus]
Every time, Every time
Every time, Every time
Every time, Every time
I'm with you
I guess it's true
[verse]
And every time
I'm with you
I'm fucked up
And you are too
Well what the hell
Else are we
Supposed to do
[chorus]
Every time, Every time
Every time, Every time
Every time, Every time
I'm with you
I guess it's true
[outro]
Every time, Every time
Every time, Every time
Every time, Every time
I'm with you
I guess it's true
