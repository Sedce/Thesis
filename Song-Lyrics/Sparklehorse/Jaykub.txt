[verse]
Jaykub
It's time for you to wake up
And accept your awards

Inside
Your tiny little one room
Apartment of the poor

Upon the podium
You smile and you wave

They all thought that you were dumb
But it's you who's on that stage
[chorus]
Jaykub
You work until the day's done
And then you go to bed
[verse]
And never
With anyone to talk to
But the hero in your head

(The hero)

Upon the podium
You're handsome and you're tall

But actually you are
Just hardly 5 foot small
[chorus]
Jaykub
It's time for you to wake up
And accept your awards
[bridge]
And go on
And smile while your landlord
Is pounding on the door

Upon the podium
You're famous and you're strong
[outro]
They may alarm
Because often you're a sad riff in a song
