[intro]
Think about the world you know
Now think of where it wants to go
All things you can see around you
You can change them
Rearrange them in your mind
[chorus]
If you love tales of transformation
Well then one two three
You could be the man who played god
[verse]
Hammer it until it breaks
To every shape that nature makes
All things you can see around you
You can change them
Rearrange them in your mind
[chorus]
If you love tales of transformation
Well then one two three
You could be the man who played god
[verse]
The girl becomes a bird on a flower
In your state you feel your power
All things you can see around you
You can change them
[bridge]
Rearrange them in your mind
If you love tales of transformation
Well then one two three
You could be the man who played god
[outro]
One two three, you could be
The man who played god
One two three, you could be
The man who played god
One two three, you could be
The man who played god
