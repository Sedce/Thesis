[verse]
Pluckin' all day on my angel's harp
Pluckin' all day on my angel's harp
Shoutin' at the risin' moon
Knowin' that I will soon stay
At the edge of the plain
On the top of the scarp
[verse]
I'm pluckin' all day on my angel's harp
Though you made me a buffoon
You did not hear the words that I did croon
I'm pluckin' all day on my angel's harp
I knew you'd finally come around
Won't you please enjoy the sound?
I didn't say clap
And I didn't stay sharp
I'm pluckin' all day on my angel's harp
And when I saw your eyes, all brown
I pulled them boy and lo I cut you down
At the edge of the plain
On the top of the scarp
This is where we all will fall
This is what we shall call kill
Pluckin' all day on our angel's harp
A resonator is soundin' dark
Though you might be walkin' tall
Everybody got a lot to grow
Pluckin' all day on my angel's harp
Pluckin' all day on my angel's harp
This is where I'm jumpin' off
This is where I sail aloft
