[intro]
Dark dream world
All alone
[chorus]
Shadows movin'
Shadows have long gone by
Shadows have long gone by
[verse]
Dark night of the soul
Our souls
Time slippin' by
I call out your pain
All alone
[chorus]
Shadows movin'
Shadows movin'
Shadows have long gone by
[verse]
Dark night of the soul
If you had only liked my face
Where are you baby
Where are you baby
Dark dream world

Shadows have long gone by
Dark night of the soul
[bridge]
Distant bell ring
But steps echo
No one on these streets
Callin' out your name
Where are you baby
[outro]
It's a dream world
Dark dream world
Dark night of the soul
