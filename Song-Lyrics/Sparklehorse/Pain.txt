[intro]
Ow! Ow!
[verse]
A massive headache in my aging skull
Means I do not feel well
[chorus]
Pain, pain, pain
Bad brains must always feel pain
[verse]
The problem started with my attitude
It's all lust, direct and crude
There are good people in this world of bums
But, sadly, I am not one
[chorus]
Pain, pain, pain
That's why I'll always be in pain

Good karma will not get you anywhere
Look at Jesus and his hair
[bridge]
Pain, pain, pain
Bad brains must always feel pain

Justice, religion, and success are fake
And the shiny people stink
[verse]
Pretty creepy, pretty funny
I'm a mix of god and monkey
[outro]
Pain, pain, pain
To feel pain is all that will remain
Pain, pain, pain, pain, paaaaaaaaain

Pain
Pain
Et cetera, I give up, I quit!
