Daddy's gone
Daddy's gonnna go to work today
To make a little money
Gotta get paid

Bake a cake
Bake a cake and set it on a plate
Up high where the dogs can't get it
So it don't get ate

When you lay your head on your pillow I'll be gone
I'll be gone
Will you breathe your dreams into your pillow like a song
I woke up and all my yesterdays were gone

Close your eyes
Close your eyes until your dreams arise
Keep 'em tight where the hounds can't get 'em
So they don't get ate

When you raise your head from your pillow don't delay
Cause people decay
Will you let the rays of the sun help you along
I woke up and all my yesterdays were gone [x4]
