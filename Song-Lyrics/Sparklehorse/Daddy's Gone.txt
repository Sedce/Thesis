[intro]
Daddy's gone
Daddy's gonnna go to work today
To make a little money
Gotta get paid
[verse]
Bake a cake
Bake a cake and set it on a plate
Up high where the dogs can't get it
So it don't get ate
[chorus]
When you lay your head on your pillow I'll be gone
I'll be gone
Will you breathe your dreams into your pillow like a song
I woke up and all my yesterdays were gone
[verse]
Close your eyes
Close your eyes until your dreams arise
Keep 'em tight where the hounds can't get 'em
So they don't get ate
[bridge]
When you raise your head from your pillow don't delay
Cause people decay
Will you let the rays of the sun help you along
[outro]
I woke up and all my yesterdays were gone
I woke up and all my yesterdays were gone
I woke up and all my yesterdays were gone
I woke up and all my yesterdays were gone
