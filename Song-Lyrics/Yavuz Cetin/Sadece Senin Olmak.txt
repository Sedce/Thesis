My love for you is an everflowing water

Tell me, do you feel like this too?

There is nothing else on my mind

Other than you nowadays

Only your love consoles me

It makes me forget all my troubles

Tonight, hold me in your caring arms

I don't actually ask for much

I don't actually ask for much

I've only wanted to be yours in this world

Only to belong to you
 
I've discovered anew the feeling that is called love

I've only wanted to be yours

I've only wanted to be yours
 

Tonight, being on your mind is not enough for me

I want to be near you

Tonight, being in your dreams is not enough for me

I want to be in your bed

I want to be in your bed
 

Only your love consoles me

It makes me forget all my troubles

Tonight, hold me in your caring arms

I don't actually ask for much
I don't actually ask for much

I've only wanted to be yours in this world

Only to belong to you
 

I've discovered anew the feeling that is called love

I've only wanted to be yours

I've only wanted to be yours
