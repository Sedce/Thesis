[verse]Living with me makes you feel sick
You say that every day
You want everything to be brand new like before
Our tired love doesn't have the strength to stand
I don't understand what is going on
But there is no doubt it is over
 [chorus]
The day comes when everyone walks their own way
Everything ends the way they have started[verse]
You call the days you shared with me
Wasted time
You say that it is difficult now
To recall beautiful moments
 
Our tired love doesn't have the strength to stand
I don't understand what is going on
But there is no doubt it is over
 
[chorus]The day comes when everyone walks their own way
Everything ends the way they have started
