[verse]
Toy world toy world...

This game is very easy,you play it too..
Break and pour,make and ruin...
Start again...
We are all children actually..

[chorus] 
Some play the military

Some play "cops and robbers"

Some play the house

I do play the musician now
 
[verse]
Some children never get calm

They always be the party-pooper...
They constantly made other children sad..

The rules of the game always ruined...
 

[chorus]
Some play "hide-and-seek"
Some play the chasing

Some play the doctorship

I do play the musician now...
