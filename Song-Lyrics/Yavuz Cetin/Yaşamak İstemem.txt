Everything that I've been taught
Everything that I've been suggested
The life that is imposed on me
Is a useless trash
 
Systems you have created
Methods you have used
 
I don't want to live among you any longer x4
 
Maybe I'm the one upside-down
I couldn't make it in this order
I've started to look for a place to hide
In the city of reptiles
 
Educated dogs
Voracious monkeys
 
I don't want to live among you any longer x4
 
How did you succeed in creating a soulless out of me?
How did you succeed in creating a senseless out of me?
How did you succeed in creating a dissonant out of me?
How did you succeed in creating one of you out of me?
 
I don't want to live among you any longer...
