[chorus]
Do you want to fly with me tonight
Are you afraid of being high
For a long time from the ground
The world does not escape once
We are on the go
Come with me
Forget your troubles
Ruzgar waits for us
I will not waste any more time

Do you want to fly with me tonight
Are you afraid of being high
For a long time from the ground
The world does not escape once
We are on the go
Come with me
Forget your troubles
Ruzgar waits for us
I will not waste any more time

[verse]
Come with me
Forget your troubles
Ruzgar waits for us
I will not waste any more time
