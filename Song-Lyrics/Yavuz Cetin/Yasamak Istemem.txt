[verse]
Everything that I've been taught

Everything that I've been suggested

The life that is imposed on me

Is a useless trash
 

Systems you have created

Methods you have used
[chorus]

I don't want to live among you any longer

I don't want to live among you any longer
 
I don't want to live among you any longer
 
I don't want to live among you any longer

[verse]  

Maybe I'm the one upside-down

I couldn't make it in this order

I've started to look for a place to hide

In the city of reptiles
 
Educated dogs

Voracious monkeys

[chorus]
I don't want to live among you any longer
I don't want to live among you any longer
I don't want to live among you any longer
I don't want to live among you any longer
[bridge]
How did you succeed in creating a soulless out of me?

How did you succeed in creating a senseless out of me?

How did you succeed in creating a dissonant out of me?

How did you succeed in creating one of you out of me?
 

[outro]
I don't want to live among you any longer...
