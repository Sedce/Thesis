I知 going to the place, the place where the wind blows
To under the tree that痴 like your hair

While leaning against the shaking train, I write you a letter
About the path I saw in my dream; I知 standing in that path

Although it痴 an unstable happiness that I anticipate yet fear;
Although there will be days when the sky we look at and the people we see

Will be hard on us; For our new dreams,
Go to the place where the wind blows. I知 going to that place.

The place where the sun dazzles, I知 going to that place.
As I let myself follow the winds, I知 going to that place.

Even if I get stopped by the rolling waves, i値l look at the horizon
To the place where the sun smiles; I知 going to that place.

The place where the leaves beckon for me, I知 going to that place.
As I walk and whistle, I think of you.

Even though I miss your voice I can稚 look back to you.
To the place where the wind blows, I知 going to that place
