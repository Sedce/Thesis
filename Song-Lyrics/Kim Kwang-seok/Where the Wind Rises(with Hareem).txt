[verse]
I’m going to the place, the place where the wind blows
To under the tree that’s like your hair
[bridge]
While leaning against the shaking train, I write you a letter
About the path I saw in my dream; I’m standing in that path
[chorus]
Although it’s an unstable happiness that I anticipate yet fear;
Although there will be days when the sky we look at and the people we see

Will be hard on us; For our new dreams,
Go to the place where the wind blows. I’m going to that place.

The place where the sun dazzles, I’m going to that place.
As I let myself follow the winds, I’m going to that place.
[verse]
Even if I get stopped by the rolling waves, i’ll look at the horizon
To the place where the sun smiles; I’m going to that place.

The place where the leaves beckon for me, I’m going to that place.
As I walk and whistle, I think of you.
[outro]
Even though I miss your voice I can’t look back to you.
To the place where the wind blows, I’m going to that place
