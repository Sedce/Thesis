[intro]
Please, let's peel off even a corner
Please, of your leather mask 
[verse]
With progressive thought, attempt to access your interior
Your mind in chaos as you access it daily
Let's cast away shame and instead aim for success
Come on, Leather Face!
[bridge]
Please, let's sell love
Please, at high risk but low return...shall we?
[verse]
Even if your physical body aches
Cover up your porno soul!
Brimming with jealousy, you've got an icy demeanor
Haven't you had enough, Leather Face?
[verse]
So!! I'd say you've got pride like a cat whiskers
       I'll snip it all off!
So!! a Nopperabou terrified of mice 
       That's what you are...Hahaha
[chorus]
Take off your LEATHER FACE
My dear LEATHER FACE
Come on, Leather Face!
Peel off your leather mask!
[bridge]
Too late now to play innocent
So hunch your back all you want
[verse]
There's no redemption once your lies are exposed
Trust commits murder suicide with love
It's that leather face of yours that's cursed
But it's too late now
[chorus]
So!! scrape up, piece back together
       Your shattered dreams
So!! churn out all the rubbish arguments you want
       You're but a fake, Leather Face

Good bye LEATHER FACE
My dear LEATHER FACE
Bye bye bye LEATHER FACE
Take off your LEATHER FACE

Take off your LEATHER FACE
Good bye LEATHER FACE
Take off your LEATHER FACE
Take off your LEATHER
