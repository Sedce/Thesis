[chorus]
A gentle rain embraces you 
Soon you will ascend into the sky 
The snow colored clouds take the pink color of cherry trees 
It takes you away under that endless sky 
In the cage that is called freedom
[verse]
A gentle rain embraces you 
Soon you will ascend into the sky 
The snow colored clouds take the pink color of cherry trees 
It takes you away under that endless sky 
In the cage that is called freedom
