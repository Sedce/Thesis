[verse]
Use just once and destroy
Invasion of our piracy
Afterbirth of a nation
Starve without your skeleton key
I love you for what I am not
I did not want what I have got
A blanket acne'ed with cigarette burns
Speak at once while taking turns

[chorus]
What is wrong with me
What is wrong with me
What is wrong with me

[verse]
Nothing to do with what you think
If you ever think at all
Bi-polar opposites attract
All of a sudden my water broke
I love you for what I am not
Did not want what I have got
A blanket acne'ed with cigarette burns
Second-rate third degree burns

[chorus]
What is what I need?
What is wrong with me?
What do I think I think?
 

[bridge]
Hate, hate your enemies
Save, save your friends
Find, find your place
Speak, speak the truth

[chorus]
What is what I need?
What is wrong with me?
What do I think I think?

[verse]
Use just once and destroy
Invasion of our piracy
Afterbirth of a nation
Starve without your skeleton key

[chorus]
What is wrong with me?
What is what I need?
What is what I need?
What do I think I think?
What is wrong with me?
What is wrong with me?
What is wrong with me?
What do I think I think?
