[verse]
I am my own parasite
I don't need a host to live
We feed off of each other
We can share our endorphins

[chorus]
Doll steak
Test meat

[bridge]
Look on the bright side, suicide
Lost eyesight I'm on your side
Angel left wing, right wing, broken wing
Lack of iron and/or sleeping

[verse]
I own my own pet virus
I get to pet and name her
Her milk is my shit
My shit is her milk

[chorus]
Test meat
Doll steak
 

[chorus]
Look on the bright side, suicide
Lost eyesight I'm on your side
Angel left wing, right wing, broken wing
Lack of iron and/or sleeping

[chorus]
Doll steak
Test meat

[bridge]
Look on the bright side, suicide
Lost eyesight I'm on your side
Angel left wing, right wing, broken wing
Lack of iron and/or sleeping

[outro]
Protector of the kennel
Ecto-plasma, ecto-skeletal
Obituary birthday
Your scent is still here in my place of recovery
