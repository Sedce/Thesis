[intro]
The two thinking about the same thing
The two talking but not talking
The two looking into each other's eyes
And you trying to hide
[chorus]
And here a guitar sounds
On the island of Palma
Where some hands run a mast
To say without words:
Uh, I love you, I love you
Uh, I love you, I love you
[verse]
Two stars have fallen from the sky
And your face has gone to your face
It has become two eyes, so green
That are confused at the bottom of the sea
[chorus]
And here a guitar sounds
On the island of Palma
Where some hands run a mast
To say without words:
Uh, I love you, I love you
Uh, I love you, I love you
[chorus]
And here a guitar sounds
On the island of Palma
Where some hands run a mast
To say without words:
Uh, I love you, I love you
Uh, I love you, I love you
Uh, I love you, I love you
Uh, I love you, I love you
Uh, I love you, I love you
Uh, I love you, I love you
Uh, I love you, I love you
Uh, I love you, I love you
[outro]
Uh, I love you, I love you
Uh, I love you, I love you
