[chorus]
Shadows sleep coiled in the hand
Cast from distant fires
Tired eyes so dry
So full of sand
Just remember that you won't take it
You won't take anymore
Please don't take it
Turn around and reach out to the shore
[verse]
From this mortal seed
Turning deep inside
There's a wound which cannot bleed
For the pleasures we have been denied
All you want to be only we can decide
Try to get ahead, but standing
Like a statue on the edge
You talk about a new direction
But the words fly out and disappear
High windows shine, the light seems like a sign
But there's a crowd down there laughing
But don't seem to hear
Oh it's the same today, always just the same as before
Can't be the same today, step out don't be afraid
You've got the right, got the right for more
[chorus]
Shadows sleep coiled in the hand
Cast from distant fires
Tired eyes so dry
So full of sand
Just remember that you won't take it
You won't take anymore
Please don't take it
Turn around and reach out to the shore
