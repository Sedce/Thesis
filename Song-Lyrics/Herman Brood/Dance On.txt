[verse]
When everything around you turns to shit
And all your friends have split
All your lovers have gone
From this - to a life of bliss

I don't deserve to die stinkin' like this
I don't deserve to die stinkin' like this

Though she's gone
I dance on
Though she's gone
I dance on
[chorus]
When everything around you turns to shit
And all your friends have split
All your lovers have gone from this
To a life of bliss

I don't deserve to die stinkin' like this
I don't deserve to die stinkin' like this

Though she's gone
I dance on
Though she's gone
I dance on


I don't deserve to die stinkin' like this
I don't deserve to die stinkin' like this

Though she's gone
I dance on
Though she's gone
I dance on (I dance on)
[bridge]
Got to dance on
Gonna dance on - (dance - dance yeah)
Never mind that she's gone
Got to dance on (I dance on)
[outro]
I dance on (I dance on)
Gonna dance on (I dance on)
(I dance on)
I dance on (I dance on) I dance on

Got to dance on (I dance on)
Gonna dance on (I dance on) on
Gonna dance on (I dance on) gonna dance on
I dance on
