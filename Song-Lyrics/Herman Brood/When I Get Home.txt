[verse]
When I get home
I'm gonna sit on my bed
When I get home
The feed back in my head
When I get home
I won't answer the phone
[bridge]
But right now, right now, right now I'm here on the road
[chorus]
When I get home
I'm gonna touch your hair
When I get home
I'm gonna touch you there
When I get home
I'll be on top of you
[bridge]
But right now, right now, right now I'm here on my own
[verse]
When I get home
I knew it ain't no sceen
When I get home
You knew I take of my skin
When I get home
I dance around in my doors
[bridge]
But right now, right now, right now I'm cruisin' alone
 
[chorus]
When I get home
I'm gonna see my girls
When I get home
I'm gonna buy them a toy
When I get home
There gonna jump with joy
[bridge]
But right now, right now, right now I'm flying alone
