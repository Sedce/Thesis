[verse]
Now I was lookin' for love
In all the wrong places
Lookin' for love
Starin' into black faces

Now I was tryin' so hard to find love
In every corner of the city
Lookin' for love
All over town
[chorus]
Took me so long - (so long)
So long (so long)
Before I met you
Took me so long - (so long)
So long (so long)
To get you

It took me so long - (so long)
Too long (so long)
To get close to you
Took me so long - (so long)
So long (so long)
Now I'm tryin' to forget you
[bridge]
Took me so long - (so long)
(so long)

So long - (so long)
So long - (so long)
[chorus]
Took me so long - (so long)
(so long)
Starin' into the black faces

So long - (so long)
So long - (so long)

Lookin' (so long) for love (so long)
In all the wrong places
(so long)
(so long)
[outro]
Lookin' (so long) for love (so long)
In every corner of the city
