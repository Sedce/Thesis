Now I was lookin' for love
in all the wrong places
lookin' for love
starin' into black facesNow I was tryin' so hard to find love
in every corner of the city
lookin' for love
all over townTook me so long - (so long)
so long (so long)
Before I met you
Took me so long - (so long)
so long (so long)
to get you
