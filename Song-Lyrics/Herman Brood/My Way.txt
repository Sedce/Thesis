And now the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friends I say it clear
I'll state my case of which I'm certain
I've loved a life that's full
I've travelled each and every highway
And more much more than this
I did it my wayRegrets I had a few
But then again too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without excemption
I planned each chattered course
Each careful stap along the highway
And more much more than that
I did it my way
