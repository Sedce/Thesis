[verse]
Rape me
Rape me, my friend
Rape me
Rape me again

[chorus]
I'm not the only one
I'm not the only one
I'm not the only one
I'm not the only one

[verse]
Hate me
Do it and do it again
Waste me
Rape me, my friend

[chorus]
I'm not the only one
I'm not the only one
I'm not the only one
I'm not the only one
 

[Bbridge]
My favorite inside source
I'll kiss your open sores
I appreciate your concern
You're gonna sink and burn

[verse]
Rape me
Rape me, my friend
Rape me
Rape me again

[chorus]
I'm not the only one
I'm not the only one
I'm not the only one
I'm not the only one

[outro]
Rape me! Rape me! Rape me!
Rape me! Rape me! Rape me!
Rape me!
(Good!)
