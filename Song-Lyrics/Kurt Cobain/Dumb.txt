[verse]
I'm not like them
But I can pretend
The sun is gone
But I have a light
The day is done
But I'm having fun
I think I'm dumb

[chorus]
Or maybe just happy
Think I'm just happy
Think I'm just happy
Think I'm just happy

[verse]
My heart is broke
But I have some glue
Help me inhale
And mend it with you
We'll float around
And hang out on clouds
Then we'll come down

[chorus]
And I have a hangover
Have a hangover
Have a hangover
Have a hangover
 

[bridge]
Skin the sun, fall asleep
Wish away, the soul is cheap
Lesson learned, wish me luck
Soothing burn, wake me up

[verse]
I'm not like them
But I can pretend
The sun is gone
But I have a light
The day is done
But I'm having fun
I think I'm dumb

[chorus]
Or maybe just happy
Think I'm just happy
Think I'm just happy
Think I'm just happy

[outro]
I think I'm dumb
I think I'm dumb
I think I'm dumb
I think I'm dumb
I think I'm dumb
I think I'm dumb
I think I'm dumb
I think I'm dumb
I think I'm dumb
I think I'm dumb
I think I'm dumb
I think I'm dumb
