[verse]
Teenage angst has paid off well
Now I'm bored and old
Self-appointed judges judge
More than they absolve
If she floats then she is not
A witch like we have thought
A downpayment on another
One at Salem's lot

[chorus]
Serve the servants, oh no
Serve the servants, oh no
Serve the servants, oh no
Serve the servants
That legendary divorce is such a bore

[verse]
As my bones grew they did hurt
They hurt really bad
I tried hard to have a father
But instead I had a dad
I just want you to know that I
Don't hate you anymore
There is nothing I could say
That I haven't thought before
 

[chorus]
Serve the servants, oh no
Serve the servants, oh no
Serve the servants, oh no
Serve the servants
That legendary divorce is such a bore

[chorus]
Serve the servants, oh no
Serve the servants, oh no
Serve the servants, oh no
Serve the servants
That legendary divorce is such a bore
