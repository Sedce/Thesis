As I look back on my life and times
My pleasures have been few
And my only happy memories
Are when I remember you

I loved you
The moment I saw you
Before I crossed the crowded room, my heart adored you
And all you said was, “I’m glad to meet you”
And the earth moved all around me
Love had finally found me

I loved you
My heart wrote you a letter
And every time I saw you on the street, I knew you better
Oh, but you know, I was only dreaming
Deep within, my secret splendor
I’m sure you don’t remember

Once upon a time, I met a girl who had the prettiest blue eyes
But after all the times I’ve tried
And all the times I cried
Those pretty blue eyes would never notice me

And if they ever give awards for the loneliest story
Well, I’d be there when they give them out
And I’d win without a doubt
But there’s no fame
For tears and pain
And love that don’t work out

I love you
And I’m glad that I said it
Nothing you can say or do could make me regret it
And though my arms may never hold you
Still I wrap my love around you
Thank God above I found you

Na na-na na, na-na na, na-na na-na na na
Na na-na na, na-na na, na-na na-na na-na-na
Na na-na na, na-na na, na-na na-na na na
Na na-na na, na-na na, na
Na na-na na, na-na na, na
