[intro]
Clara would be proud to know us
We've taken it to the end
Where the grey turns to black
And the white just begins-
[bridge]
We live everyday on the water
The night just kills the pain
From the suffering that was
We are no stronger-we are dust-
[chorus]
Down in the crowd we're down
On our knees
Wanna get out but
Don't wanna succeed
We're the red-eyed legends
Of the night before
We're the dead mind babies
Of the T.V. war-
[outro]
Living in a rectory of sin
Against the currents we all swim
Cageless wonders of sometime when
The paper icon's chase will end-
