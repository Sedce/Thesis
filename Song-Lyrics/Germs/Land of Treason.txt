[intro]
Land of treason-waste no reason-
We are breathing fire

We're packs of dogs-
We're enemies of men-we are not desired

Our face show-
We've grown cold-but

Have not conspired

[verse]
Old hearts gone-
The future's on-mother nations mired

I like a recepticle for the chosen dead

We find our bodies clawed

And with the scent of death

We find that we are not so very awed


Loyalties burned-
The words our blurred-overturn your own

[bridge]
Walk like dogs and watch the doors-
Have your other stone

Stop the toys that match disordered-
Calculate the thrones

Feel the pulse descending-
Decaying hallowed tomes

In the starving sense you worship-
The nations of debris

[chorus]
You wear a cost of sewage-
That you've never ever seen
 

The time is now-the vicious here-
A stolen dinner code

The license of the savage land-
That you've always sold

So bite the hand that needs you

And bless another coal

The virus never issues-
From a cotton so very old

As the lights come down

You wash your hands and start to climb

The ladder that you stole

Slip the hatch-and spin the sword-
The money lords are poor

Push the tan-that rolls downhill-
Their sense of dream absorbed

Still the cat that breaks the night-
Tie him to the core

Chase the viruses that believe-
That what's right is scored

It's a senseless cash in of right for right-
What's wrong is never gone

And left is just a bastion for the fools

Golden dawn
