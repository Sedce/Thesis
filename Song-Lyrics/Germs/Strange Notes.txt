[verse]
Billy Druids face is marble
He keeps every thought in its place
He lets the days turn tomorrow
Someone's always walking
On his grave
He wears the lines just like Garbo
And talks at a saturmine pace
Listening to the strange notes marvel
Only giving what it takes

[chorus]
It's a sad man's world
And for Billy it's sure to crown
Dragging beauty into darkness
Inflcting a pale white frown

And the matter the runs
Through Billy's head
Is too concerned to fall
