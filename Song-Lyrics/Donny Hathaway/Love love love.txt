[verse]
Love love love why'd you take so long to come to me aww baby
Love love yo love tell me where you hiding from me all the time
Each time I try to find someone to take your place
It was all in vain, no their lips were never quite the same aww baby
When I was kiss someone new deep inside I was missing you
[chorus]
Aww baby you make me fall in love with you 
now I don't know just what I'm gonna do
Aww honey I looked out into empty space and all I saw was your sweet face
[verse]
Love love love you can't imagine what you did to me aww baby

Day by day I'm fallin more in love with you 
And thats no lie, cross my heart and honey I hope to die

Aww honey I looked out into empty space and all I saw was your sweet face
