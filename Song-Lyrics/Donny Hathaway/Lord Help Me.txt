[chorus]
(Lord help me)
(Lord help me)
(Lord help me) once more again, your humble servant is calling on your name
(Lord help me) I've got something I want you to do for me
[verse]
Help me to inspire those that need inspiration
Let my life be a sign of a coming generation
(Lord help me) and I'm also asking you to help my brother
(Lord help me) he needs help too Lord
Help him to know that there's a purpose for living
And Lord, hey, Lord, I want you to help him this evening
