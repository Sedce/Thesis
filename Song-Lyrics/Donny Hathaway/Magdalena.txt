[Verse 1:]
Magdalena sits in her chair speaking of the mass
She talks in slicing splinters, she laughs like breaking glass
She says that she would have me spirit her away
Stealing all my images 'til there's nothing left to say

[Chorus:]
Oh, Magdalena
Nothing like the saint you are
Your love is like a razor
My heart is just a-scar
Oh, Magdalena
Nothing like the saint you are

[Verse 2:]
Magdalena lying there could make a dancer stumble
Make a preacher bite his tongue and leave him with a mumble
And if you think I'm crazy, babe, or that I'm funning you
Just pay your dues and lose your blues
When Maggie is kissing you

[Chorus:]
Oh, Magdalena
Nothing like the saint you are
Your love is like a razor
My heart is just a-scar
Oh, Magdalena
Nothing like the saint you are

[Chorus:]
Oh, Magdalena
Nothing like the saint you are
Your love is like a razor
My heart is just a-scar
Oh, Magdalena
Nothing like the saint you are
