Nothing feels better than my baby's arms
They've around me a long time
Nothing feels better than some good news
Makes you glad to face the new times

I tell you nothing's better
When there's no need to look
'Cause you know who's there
I smile the world over

When I think of the past
How we past all the test
Through the good and the bad
And that's why I wanna see it by now

No, I ain't got nobody else in mind
I know it's you
No, I ain't got nobody else in mind
I know it's you

Home is the castle you built in my mind
I'm home anywhere, anytime
Peaceful and patience, easy taken time
It's so nice to have a simple mind

I tell you nothing's better
When there's no need to look
'Cause you know who's there
I smile the world over

When I think of the past
How we passed all the test
Through the good and the bad
And that's why I wanna see by now

No, I ain't got nobody else in mind
'Cause I know it's you
That's the reason I wanna stay right here
'Cause I ain't got nobody else in mind
I know it's you

No, I ain't got nobody else in mind
I know it's you
