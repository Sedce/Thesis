[chorus]
Come little children I'll take thee away
Into a land of enchantment
Came little children the time's come to play
Here in my garden of shadows
[verse]
Follow us little children I'll show thee the way through all the pain and sorrows ..
Weak not poor children the life is this way
Murdering beauty and passion
Hush now little children
It must be this way to weary of life and exception
Rest now my children for soon we'll away
Into the calm and the quite
Uh Uh Uh..
[chorus]
Come little children I'll take thee away into a land of enchantment
Came little children the time's come to play
Here in my garden of shadows
Uh Uh Uh...
