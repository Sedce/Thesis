Every time I'm with you
I am drunk
And you are too
Well what the hell
Else are we
Supposed to do
Yeah every time
You come by
We get so trashed
And stay up all night
Well it's so wrong
But it's so right
Yeah, it's alright
Every time, Every time
Every time, Every time
Every time, Every time
I'm with you
I guess it's true
Every time, Every time
Every time, Every time
Every time, Every time
I'm with you
I guess it's true
And every time
I'm with you
I'm fucked up
And you are too
Well what the hell
Else are we
Supposed to do
Every time, Every time
Every time, Every time
Every time, Every time
I'm with you
I guess it's true
Every time, Every time
Every time, Every time
Every time, Every time
I'm with you
I guess it's true
