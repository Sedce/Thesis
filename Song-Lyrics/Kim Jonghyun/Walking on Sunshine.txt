I used to think maybe you loved me now baby I'm sure
And I just can't wait till the day when you knock on my door
Now every time I go for the mailbox, gotta hold myself down
'Cause I just can't wait 'til you write me you're coming around
I'm walking on sunshine (Wow!)
I'm walking on sunshine (Wow!)
I'm walking on sunshine (Wow!)
And don't it feel good
Hey, alright now
And don't it feel good, hey
I used to think maybe you loved me, now I know that it's true
And I don't want to spend my whole life, just waiting for you
Now I don't want you back for the weekend
Not back for a day, no no no
I said baby I just want you back
And I want you to stay (Oh yeah now!)
I'm walking on sunshine (Wow!)
I'm walking on sunshine (Wow!)
I'm walking on sunshine (Wow!)
And don't it feel good
Hey, alright now
And don't it feel good (Yeah!)
And don't it feel good
Walking on sunshine
Walking on sunshine
I feel the love, I feel the love, I feel the love that's really real
I feel the love, I feel the love, I feel the love that's really real
I'm on sunshine baby (Ow! Oh yeah!)
I'm on sunshine baby (Ow!)
I'm walking on sunshine (Wow!)
I'm walking on sunshine (Wow!)
I'm walking on sunshine (Wow!)
And don't it feel good (Hey! Alright now!)
And don't it feel good (I'll say it I'll say it I'll say it again now)
And don't it feel good (Hey yeah now!)
And don't it feel good (Don't it, don't it, don't it, don't it, don't it, don't it)
Feel good
And don't it feel good
And don't it feel good
And don't it feel good
And don't it feel good
Now don't it feel good
