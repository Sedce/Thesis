[verse]
I don’t want you to put away your eyes
When you look at me
I wanna lock eyes with you and have a staring contest
My love, see yourself reflected in my eyes
So beautiful
Please don’t be shy
I want to place you in my eyes, just as you are

Sometimes, I’m afraid to fall asleep
What if I open my eyes to a different world?
Sometimes, I have these stupid thoughts
[chorus]
My love, see yourself reflected in my eyes
So beautiful
Please don’t be shy
I want to place you in my eyes, just as you are
[verse]
No one knew we’d fall in love like this
You don’t even know how big my feelings are
Of course, of course my feelings are bigger
But you say you love me more
No I love you more
[chorus]
My love, see yourself reflected in my eyes
So beautiful
Please don’t be shy
I want to place you in my eyes, just as you are
[chorus]
My love, see yourself reflected in my eyes
So beautiful
Please don’t be shy
I want to place you in my eyes, just as you are
