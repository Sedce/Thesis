I’m sorry, it’s my fault
Thank you, it’s all thanks to you
These were words you said out of habit
Even though I knew you were struggling too
You probably think I’m a fool
If I say that things are hard with a crying face
Will it really get better
If I cry and say it hurts, who will have a harder time
Everyone will be fine

Maybe we trapped each other
Inside our own misunderstandings
No, you don’t understand me
Whenever I see your worried eyes

Baby I’m so lonely so lonely
I feel like I’m alone
When I see you so tired, I worry
that I’m baggage to you, that I’m too much

Baby I’m so lonely so lonely
I feel like I’m alone
I don’t want to make it obvious to you
I’m used to just holding it in
Understand me

We’re together but we’re not walking together
Loneliness and misery, the difference is only one memory (Ooh)
But why do you keep trying to write it as something else

Baby I’m so lonely so lonely
I feel like I’m alone
I don’t want to make it obvious to you
I’m used to just holding it in
Understand me

Leave me alone

Baby I’m so lonely so lonely
I feel like I’m alone

Baby I’m so lonely so lonely
I feel like I’m alone
Still, I don’t wanna hide it from you
But I’m used to just holding it in

It's the heart on your sleeve never making me wonder
It's the bond that we tie up and over and under
You're the sun and the rain and my grass is always green
With a kiss on my cheek, always letting me know
I'm the birds and the bees, I'm the apple in your eye
I know that you know that I know you're all I need
And just when I thought
It couldn't get any better
There you go and do it all again
Hope this feeling never ends
'Cause you
You make me happy
You
You make me happy
It's the sound of your voice at the end of the phone line
A tickle in my toes, just to know that you're all mine
Like an ice cream sundae with a cherry on the top
It's the look in your eyes when I'm wearing your t-shirt
Your cute little smile after a long day of hard work
And I know that you know that I can't give you up
And just when I thought
It couldn't get any better
There you go and do it all again
Hope this feeling never ends
'Cause you
You make me happy
You
You make me happy
Just when I thought
It couldn't get any better
There you go and do it all again
Hope this feeling never ends
'Cause you
You make me happy
You
You make me happy
You
Make me happy
You
You make me happy
