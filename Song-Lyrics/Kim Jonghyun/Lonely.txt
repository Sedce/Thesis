[Verse 1: JONGHYUN]
I’m sorry, it’s my fault
Thank you, it’s all thanks to you
These were words you said out of habit
Even though I knew you were struggling too
You probably think I’m a fool

[Verse 2: TAEYEON]
If I say that things are hard with a crying face
Will it really get better?
If I cry and say it hurts, who will have a harder time?
Everyone will be fine

[Pre-Chorus: JONGHYUN, TAEYEON]
Maybe we trapped each other
Inside our own misunderstandings
No, you don’t understand me
Whenever I see your worried eyes

[Chorus: JONGHYUN, TAEYEON]
Baby I’m so Lonely so Lonely
I feel like I’m alone
When I see you so tired
I worry that I’m baggage to you
That I’m too much
Baby I’m so Lonely so Lonely
I feel like I’m alone
I don’t want to make it obvious to you
I’m used to just holding it in
Understand me

[Pre-Chorus: JONGHYUN, Together]
We’re together but we’re not walking together
Loneliness and misery, the difference is only one memory
But why do you keep trying to write it as something else?

[Chorus: JONGHYUN, TAEYEON]
Baby I’m so Lonely so Lonely
I feel like I’m alone
I don’t want to make it obvious to you
I’m used to just holding it in
Understand me

[Hook: TAEYEON]
Leave me alone

[Pre-Chorus: TAEYEON]
Baby I’m so Lonely so Lonely
I feel like I’m alone

[Chorus: JONGHYUN, TAEYEON]
Baby I’m so Lonely so Lonely
I feel like I’m alone
Still, I don’t wanna hide it from you
But I’m used to just holding it in
Understand me
