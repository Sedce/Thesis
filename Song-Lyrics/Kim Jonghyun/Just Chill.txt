[intro]
No, no, no, no, no
Yeah
I’m just chilling
[verse]
Sometimes, I wanna be alone, in my empty room
I wanna lay in bed and not think about anything
Sometimes, I wanna push back all the things
that suffocate me and be quiet
[chorus]
Oh, the sound of the rain has come to me
Pit pat, it knocks on my window
But I don’t wanna open
I wanna be alone
Let me be still just for today
I’m gonna turn on the AC and get under the covers
I wanna be wasteful

What do you do in your free time?
I just chill out oh, oh
What do you do when your heart is tired?
I just chill out, oh baby
[verse]
I’m gonna lay down
and roll around
Watch old, popular TV dramas and movies
Or read comic books I read when I was a student
Turning off my phone, SNS, friends,
my ex, please be quiet
[chorus]
Oh, the sound of the rain has come to me
Pit pat, it knocks on my window
But I don’t wanna open
I wanna be alone
Let me be still just for today
I’m gonna turn on the AC and get under the covers
I wanna be wasteful

What do you do in your free time?
I just chill out oh, oh
What do you do when your heart is tired?
I just chill out, oh baby
[verse]
Sometimes I get scared, am I gonna be forever alone?
Everyone thinks it’s a waste but it’s not too bad
I’m gonna be lazy in my quiet room all day, oh
Only gonna sleep
[chorus]
What do you do in your free time?
I just chill out oh, oh
What do you do when your heart is tired?
I just chill out, oh baby
