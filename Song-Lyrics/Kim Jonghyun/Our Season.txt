[verse]
A warm winter has come again
Coats, scarves, sweaters, mittens
Even without those things, I’m not cold
Because you’re always by my side

Let’s be honest now, you’ve been disappointed in me, right?
Yes, I’ve been hurt by you too
But like the snow melts in warm winters
All of those things became memories now
[chorus]
Grateful feelings keep remaining
Your words keep lingering in my ears
So it’s not cold at all today, on this warm winter
Because you’re always by my side
[verse]
White air came out of my mouth
And I used to put my frozen hands in my pockets
But I didn’t know this day would come
It feels like a dream

I’ll be back, those are such pretty words
Because it’s a goodbye to meet again on a promise
Just like the warm winter has come back
Your heart is always by my side too
[chorus]
Grateful feelings keep remaining
Your words keep lingering in my ears
So it’s not cold at all today, on this warm winter
Because you’re always by my side
[verse]
Hey, I always say this but
I say this like a habit but
Thank you so much for loving me though I lack
Because of you, my eternity is warm
[outro]
I want to tell you, thank you
I want to return the words you gave to me
It’s not cold at all today, on this winter with you
Because you’re always by my side
