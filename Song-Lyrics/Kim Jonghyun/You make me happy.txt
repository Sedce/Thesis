It's the heart on your sleeve never making me wonder
It's the bond that we tie up and over and under
You're the sun and the rain and my grass is always green
With a kiss on my cheek, always letting me know
I'm the birds and the bees, I'm the apple in your eye
I know that you know that I know you're all I need
And just when I thought
It couldn't get any better
There you go and do it all again
Hope this feeling never ends
'Cause you
You make me happy
You
You make me happy
It's the sound of your voice at the end of the phone line
A tickle in my toes, just to know that you're all mine
Like an ice cream sundae with a cherry on the top
It's the look in your eyes when I'm wearing your t-shirt
Your cute little smile after a long day of hard work
And I know that you know that I can't give you up
And just when I thought
It couldn't get any better
There you go and do it all again
Hope this feeling never ends
'Cause you
You make me happy
You
You make me happy
Just when I thought
It couldn't get any better
There you go and do it all again
Hope this feeling never ends
'Cause you
You make me happy
You
You make me happy
You
Make me happy
You
You make me happy
