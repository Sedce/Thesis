In U.S., A's for apathy
Not bullshit democracy
Red white and blue is all you see
But does it mean you're really free?

In U.S., A's for anarchy
Not bullshit democracy
I want total liberty
I want peace and anarchy

They tell us how to act and be
Fuck that mental slavery
With standards and authority
How can you think you're really free?

Do what you want be what you be
Don't fall for their hypocrisy
Open you mind! Wake up and see!
True freedom is anarchy!
