[verse]
Inquisition says we'll burn in hell
Damnation for the infidel
Gonna start and spread some heresy?
Ya' gotta expect a certain misery
They're gonna make it really interesting
They're gonna go and teach democracy
Whatever God that could exterminate
Whatever God that can't tolerate
[chorus]
In dog we trust
In dog we trust
In dog we trust
In dog we trust
In dog we trust
In God you trust
In God you trust
In God you lust
[outro]
God damn you
God damn me
God damn who?
