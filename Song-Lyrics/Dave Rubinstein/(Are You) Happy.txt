[verse]
Nervous twitching, anxious bitching
Is something disturbing you?
Nervous laughter - what ya after?
Ha ha the joke's on you!
[chorus]
Are you really happy?
Are you happy?
Pompous bragging, neurotic nagging
Expose your insecurities
Aggravated, irritated
You're the perfect picture of misery

Are you really happy?
Huh? ...You're not happy?
[verse]
Ha ha ha... you're soooo cool
Ha ha ha... but the joke's on you!

Ha ha honey, ain't it funny
How some people are such hapless fools
Ha ha honey, ain't it funny
The punch line is the joke is you! ...ha ha ha
