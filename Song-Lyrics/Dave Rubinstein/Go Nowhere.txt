You're a gonowhere! And you don't care!
You're a gonowhere! You're not even there!

Living your life on the conveyor belt
No time to think so your brain just melts
No destination you're lost inside
Standing still, deaf dumb and blind! Go!...

A whole generation of gonowheres
The living dead in 3-D life
A whole generation of stagnant lives
Standing still, deaf dumb and blind

You're a gonowhere! And you don't care!
You're a gonowhere! You're fucking lost!
