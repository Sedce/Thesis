[intro]
Are you gonna wake again?

Are you gonna take it down?

[verse]
Oh babe, I don't wanna deal it

Oh, make it alright

Gimme some, my love

Away, away, away

[chorus]
I just wanna slide away and come alive again

I just wanna slide away and come alive again

I will see that love again, and find a life again

I just wanna slide away and come alive again

[bridge]
I wanted to let it go

Just couldn't let it go

I wanted to let it go

Just couldn't let you go

[verse]
I would catch you
(Just couldn't let you go)

I'd catch you as you fall
(Just couldn't let it go)

I would catch you
(Just couldn't let you go)

I'd catch you if I heard your call

But you tore a hole in space
Like a dark star, falls from grace

You burn across the sky

And I would find you wings to fly

And I would catch you

I would catch your fall

[outro]
I just wanna slide away and come alive again

I just wanna slide away and come alive again

I will see that love again, and find a life again

I just wanna slide away and come alive again
