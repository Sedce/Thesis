Oh give her the summer, let her live another
She warms to the kiss of goodbye
Her momma took a preacher, her daddy pays for lovers
Her eyes like a winter sky, I
Hear the echoes, calling for the secrets we hide
She's flirting for England, ah ah
She's flirting for England, ah ah
She's flirting for England, ah ah
She's flirting for England, ah ah
She comes to the party on a kiss don't tell pony
And lets me have the first of her sighs
Tricks came so easy, but you know she keeps your secrets
The tracks of the tears she will hide
Oh voices, calling for the secrets we hide
She's searching for England, ah ah
She's flirting for England, ah ah
She's flirting for England, ah ah
She's flirting for England, ah ah
Do do do do, do do do
Do do do do, do do do do
Do do do do, do do do
She's flirting for England, ah ah
She's flirting for England, ah ah
She's searching for England, ah ah
She's flirting for England, ah ah
She's flirting, flirting, flirting
She's a complicated cookie
She's flirting, flirting, flirting
She's a complicated cookie
She's flirting, flirting, flirting
She's a complicated cookie
She's flirting, flirting, flirting
She's a complicated cookie
