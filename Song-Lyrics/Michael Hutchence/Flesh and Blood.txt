[verse]
Trip away the bones and skin, looking for what lies within

See the stars so cold above

Makes no sense of your flesh and blood

You walked the longest walk, talked the toughest talk

You were outside, something inside

Took away the words, you want to hear again

You were outside, something inside
[chorus]
All of the days we thought would come

All of the words we thought had gone

All of the pain and pleasure gone without you

[verse]
Strip away the bones and skin, show me what lies within

Would you be the one that I love?

Make no sense of your flesh and blood

You walked the longest walk, talked the toughest talk

You were outside, something inside

Took away the words, you want to live again

You were outside, something inside

[chorus]
All of the days we thought would come

All of the words we thought had gone

All of the pain and pleasure gone without you

All of the days we thought would come

All of the words we thought had gone (on and on)

All of the pain and pleasure gone (pleasure gone) without you

[bridge]
We'd be making love, make it right (right, right)

All of the days we thought would come

All of the words we thought had gone (on and on)

All of the pain and pleasure gone without you

All of the days we thought would come (thought would come)

All of the words we thought had gone (on and on)

All of the pain and pleasure gone (pleasure gone) without you

[outro]
(Thought would come, on and on, pleasure gone)

(All of the days we thought would come) (thought would come)

(All of the words we thought had gone) (on and on)

(All of the pain and pleasure gone) (pleasure gone) (without you)
