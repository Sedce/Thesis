[intro]
She got the future wrapped up inside her

Every day without her feels like a crime

[chorus]
He wants to show her over & over

The way to people turn into one

Just keep breathing, breathing, breathing, breathing

[verse]
Ow! Baby, come closer whisper your secrets
I'll tell you yours if you tell me mine

Well here comes the reason deep in your nature

We're creatures always trying to prove love


Just keep breathing, breathing, breathing, breathing

Just keep breathing, breathing, breathing

She got the future wrapped up inside her

Every day without her feels like a crime

[chorus]

He wants to show her over and over

The way two people turn into one, ah!
(Ooh ah ah, oh ah ah)

Just keep breathing, breathing, breathing, breathing
Just keep breathing, breathing, breathing

[bridge]
She got the future wrapped up inside her

Every day without her feels like a crime

He wants to show her over and over

The way two people turn into one, aow!

[outro]
Just keep breathing, breathing, breathing, breathing

Just keep breathing, breathing, breathing
Breathe out, breathe out, breathe out
