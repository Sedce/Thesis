[verse]
She got the future wrapped up inside her

Every day without her feels like a crime

[chorus]
He wants to show her over & over

The way to people turn into one

[chorus]
Just keep breathing, breathing, breathing, breathing
[verse]
Ow! Baby, come closer whisper your secrets
I'll tell you yours if you tell me mine

Well here comes the reason deep in your nature

We're creatures always trying to prove love

[chorus]
Just keep breathing, breathing, breathing, breathing
Just keep breathing, breathing, breathing

[verse]
She got the future wrapped up inside her

Every day without her feels like a crime

[chorus]

He wants to show her over and over

The way two people turn into one, ah!
[bridge]
(Ooh ah ah, oh ah ah)

[chorus]
Just keep breathing, breathing, breathing, breathing
Just keep breathing, breathing, breathing
[verse]
She got the future wrapped up inside her

Every day without her feels like a crime

He wants to show her over and over

The way two people turn into one, aow!
[outro]
Just keep breathing, breathing, breathing, breathing

Just keep breathing, breathing, breathing
Breathe out, breathe out, breathe out
