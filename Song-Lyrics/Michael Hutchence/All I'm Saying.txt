You put your heart
With trust
Into my hands
I held so tight
Kept you protected from things

Did you ever think about it
Did you ever cry about it
Would you ever, ever doubt it

All I'm saying
Is come around
Tell me 'bout
The life you found

I put my heart
With trust
Into your hands
One day, changes come
Some pain and rain comes falling down

Did you ever think about it
Don't say it
Did you ever lie about it
Don't say it
Could you ever live without it
 

All I'm saying
Is come around
Tell me 'bout
The life you found
Tell me 'bout the life you found

We search endlessly
For answers to war and pain
We love the nights
Some days we laugh, feel like it's alright

Did you ever think about it
Don't say it
Did you ever cry about it
Don't say it
Could you ever live without it

All I'm saying
Is come around
Tell me 'bout
The one you found
All I'm saying
Is come around
Tell me bout
The one you found
