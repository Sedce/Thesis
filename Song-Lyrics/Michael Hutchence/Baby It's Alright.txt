[intro]
It wouldn't be right to take it
It wouldn't be right lying down
I'm sick of the dogs outside my window
That's right, take a look
You've been with a hook stuck into me
[chorus]
So baby it's alright
So baby it's alright
So baby it's alright
So baby it's alright
[verse]
Look at the mess I'm makin',
Look at that mess across your face (across your face)
As bitterness started showin'
Five years, no-one hears just another night too scared to bleed
[chorus]
So baby it's alright
So baby it's alright
So baby it's alright
So baby it's alright, yeah
[bridge]
Ah ah ah ah, yeah yeah yeah, ah ah ah, yeah yeah yeah
Uh uh uh, yeah hey hey, uh huh huh, yeah hey yeah
Give you some time to feel it;
I tangled you up in flesh and blood
Just to scared of where I took you
Spotlight blue to red crashin' in your head
[chorus]
So baby it's alright
So baby it's alright
So baby it's alright
So baby it's alright
[outro]
So baby it's alright, it's alright
So baby it's alright, it's alright
So baby it's alright, it's alright
So baby it's alright, it's alright
Yeah yeah yeah, it's alright
Ah ah ah, na na na (na na na) 
It's alright, to fall into your arms
