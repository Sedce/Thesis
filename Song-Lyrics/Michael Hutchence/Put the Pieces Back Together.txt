[chorus]
Saw a million pieces

Of the shape I'm in

Hanging from a chandelier

Have a taste of everything

[verse]
Nothing gonna get me crying out for more

Seen nothing to seduce me
Seen it all before

He's another leader
Pretty head on the block

Got another axe to grind


If the dust ain't hard

Can he taste the money dripping off the tongue

All is fair in love and war

With a cold heart and a smoking gun

[bridge]
Sooth me

Sue me

Sooth me

Sue me

Put the pieces back together

[verse]
Every moment back together

In your quiet moments

Looking back in tears

Can I count the nights you've lived

That you'd live again

Looking for the real thing to even up the score

Finding out you're lonely

With an open door

[bridge]
Sooth me

Sue me

I guess I lied too

I saw a million pieces

Of the shape I'm in

[outro]
Hanging from a chandelier

Put the pieces back together

Pussy cat, pussy cat

Where have you been?

I've been down to London

To see the queen
