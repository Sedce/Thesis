[intro]
I'm never gonna make you suffer
If you want my better side
I'm gonna give you all my sugar
When it comes to taking the ride
[verse]
I will never let your words be washed away
There are oceans to be named by you
Inside, we lay in the shadows
Outside, they push the skin parade
All the streets have turned from red to blue
It's probably gonna stay that way
Don't let me go and stop you
If you're looking for a better view
[chorus]
Gonna take a ride
(Take a ride)
From here to heaven
(Let me ride)
Gonna take a ride
(Take a ride)
Get on the inside
(Get on the inside)
Gonna take a ride
(Take a ride)
To eleventh heaven
(Let me ride)
Gonna take a ride
(Take a ride)
Get on the inside
(Get it on the inside)
Get on the inside
(Get on the inside)
Get on the inside
(Get on the inside)
Get on the inside
(Get on the inside)
(Get on the inside)
[verse]
Are we gonna kill the things that mean the most
As a junkie is a jailer too
We're gonna recognize the faces
If we're searching for the life we blew
All the streets have turned from red to blue
It's probably gonna stay that way
Don't let me go and stop you
If you're looking for a better view
[chorus]
Gonna take a ride
(Take a ride)
From here to heaven
(Let me ride)
Gonna take a ride
(Take a ride)
Get on the inside
(Get on the inside)
Gonna take a ride
(Take a ride)
From here to heaven
(Let me ride)
Gonna take a ride
(Take a ride)
Get on the inside
(Get it on the inside)
[verse]
All you people, talking so lonely
Making plans that your daddy wanted
Setting it up for the biggest falling
How you gonna learn, learn to fake it?
Having trouble with the dirty make-up
Never gonna learn what you're running from
Acting like the world just owes you
Looking for love in all the wrong places
[chorus]
Gonna take a ride
(Get on the inside, get on the inside)
(Get on the inside, get it on the inside)
Gonna take a ride from here to heaven
(Get on the inside)
Gonna take a ride, get on the inside
(Get it on the inside)
Gonna take a ride, get on the inside
(Get on the inside)
Gonna take a ride, get on the inside
(Get it on the inside)
Gonna take a ride
(Sweating it on the sweet tiny spot)
Get on the inside
(Let me ride)
Gonna take a ride
(Sweating it on the sweet tiny spot)
Get on the inside
(Let me ride)
Get on the inside
(Sweating it on the sweet tiny spot)
Get on the inside
(Let me ride)
Get on the inside
(Sweating it on the sweet tiny spot)
Get on the inside
(Let me ride)
Oh yeah
(Sweating it on the sweet tiny spot)
Oh, oh
(Let me ride)
Oh, oh
[outro]
(Sweating it on the sweet tiny spot)
Oh yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(Let me ride)
Sweating it on the sweet tiny spot
Let me ride
Sweating it on the sweet tiny spot
Get it on the inside
Sweating it on the sweet tiny spot
Let me ride
Sweating it on the sweet tiny spot
Get it on the inside
