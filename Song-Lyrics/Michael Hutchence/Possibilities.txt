[verse]
It's so strange
How my life's changed
I know nothing
About the people that I touched
Heard a story
It sounded easy
If you don't care
Then you're lying through your teeth
I was shook up
Intoxicated
Drank the juices
Of the possibilities
I'm so alive
If you told me
Nothing's perfect
Hearts are broken
Nothing's free
I could show you
Why it's worth it
That's the way that it's meant to be
It's too strange
How your life's changed
You know nothing
About the people that you've touched
Someone told me
Life is easy
Hearts were bleeding and breaking
They were lying through their teeth
If you told me
Nothing's perfect
Hearts are broken
Nothing's free
I will show you
Why it's worth it
And that's the way that it's meant to be
If you told me
Nothing's perfect
Hearts are broken
Nothing's free
I could show you
Why it's worth it
That's the way that it's meant to be
Heard a story
It sounded easy
Got a new skin and
I'm lying through my teeth
I was shook up
Intoxicated
I drank the juices of the possibilities
Of the possibilities
