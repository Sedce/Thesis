[verse]
It's so strange

How my life's changed

I know nothing

About the people that I touched

Heard a story

It sounded easy

If you don't care

[chorus]
Then you're lying through your teeth

I was shook up

Intoxicated

Drank the juices

Of the possibilities
[verse]
I'm so alive

If you told me

Nothing's perfect

Hearts are broken

Nothing's free
[bridge]
I could show you

Why it's worth it

That's the way that it's meant to be

It's too strange

How your life's changed

[chorus]
You know nothing

About the people that you've touched

Someone told me

Life is easy

Hearts were bleeding and breaking


They were lying through their teeth

If you told me

Nothing's perfect

Hearts are broken

Nothing's free

[verse]
I will show you

Why it's worth it

And that's the way that it's meant to be

If you told me

Nothing's perfect


Hearts are broken

Nothing's free

I could show you

Why it's worth it

That's the way that it's meant to be

Heard a story

It sounded easy

Got a new skin and

[outro]
I'm lying through my teeth

I was shook up

Intoxicated

I drank the juices of the possibilities

Of the possibilities
