I met her in the mall in Montreal
She was a demonstration girl for L'Oréal
She offered up her wrist, I stole a kiss
When we came up for air she told me this

What the hell's she tryin' to say
Sounds good, ok
My life was going nowhere anyway

We bought some chocolates and some cheap champagne
And caught a taxi in the pouring rain
I told her that I loved her long tan legs
She looked confused and said "bien sûr"
...and offered me a cigarette

What the hell's she tryin' to say
Sounds good, ok
My life was going nowhere anyway

Do do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do

Woke up alone; a note beside my head
And perfume samples scattered round my bed
I read the words and to my great surprise
It said, "Thanks mon cher I had a splendid time"
I had a time
