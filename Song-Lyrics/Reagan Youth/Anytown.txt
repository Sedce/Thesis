[intro]
Hey wheres spot?
Mom wheres spot?
He ran away
[chorus]
Run spot run
Run spot run
[verse]
At 6 the milkman comes around
Another day in anytown
I wake up with a frown
Another day in anytown
[verse]
Run spot run
Run spot run

I called up Sally, Dick and Mark
We took my dog spot to the park
We watched him run and heard him bark
Then spot ran way into the dark
[chorus]
Run spot run
Run spot run
[verse]
I had to go and tell my dad
I said "Anytown just makes me sad"
He said "Son, thats pretty bad"
He said "I must be going mad"
 
[bridge]
Take him away!
Take him away!
Take him away!
Take him away!
[outro]
I dont want to live in anytown
Anytown just brings me down
I dont want to live in anytown
Anytown just makes me frown
