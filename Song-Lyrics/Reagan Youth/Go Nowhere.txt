[chorus]
You're a go nowhere! And you don't care!
You're a go nowhere! You're not even there!
[verse]
Living your life on the conveyor belt
No time to think so your brain just melts
No destination you're lost inside
Standing still, deaf dumb and blind! Go!...
[verse]
A whole generation of gonowheres
The living dead in 3-D life
A whole generation of stagnant lives
Standing still, deaf dumb and blind
[chorus]
You're a gonowhere! And you don't care!
You're a gonowhere! You're fucking lost!
