[verse]
The old bat say i have no manners
Pardon me my manner is my own
I might not climb the social ladder
But I can climb the schoolyard fence
[chorus]
Got no class
I say, got no class
I say, got no class
I'm just my fuckin' self
[verse]
The old timer tries to socialize me
And keep me neatly in my place
Excuse me I'm not a category
And cheap profession is not my taste
[chorus]
Got no class
I say, got no class
I say, got no class
I'm just my fuckin' self
[verse]
And at times i might be gentle
Don't mean that I'm a gentleman
I ain't no conformist mark
I am simply what I am!
[chorus]
Got no class
I say, got no class
I say, got no class...
