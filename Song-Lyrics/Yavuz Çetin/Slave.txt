A long time ago
You entraped me
There is no else way for me
You or nothing
You or nothing
 
I sometimes looked for a path to me
There is always blues in my hand
It's very difficult to be afraid of losing you
You or nothing
You or nothing
 
I became a slave to your love x4
 
What does a man want in his life?
Some kindness,some passion, that's all
The only thing you can give me in this life
"Let's do it,let's do it"
 
I became a slave to your love...
