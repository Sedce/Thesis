[intro]
Everyday's pretty much the same 
And the way it is, I guess it's OK 
But for some reason you look up at the sky, right? 
The perfect dreams of those boys and girls 
I laugh because I can see right through those feelings 
But it's nothing serious, that's how it is
[bridge]
No matter how many years we wait 
Nothing will fall from the sky, right? 
Carry that missile in your heart and let's go
[chorus]
Speed freaks baby rocket dive 
Your off-kilter rocket 
A high-speed trip starts with a quick spark 
And so speed freaks baby rocket dive 
Even in silence the sun rises 
Say adios to those yesterdays filled with waiting
[verse]
For example, somewhere along your journey 
Your engine goes idle 
Because of that it's all a waste, right? 
But a situation made of nothing 
Can be turned into anything 
So you can go anywhere you want to
[bridge]
A towering rocket 
Let's blast off before it rusts 
Launch as many times as we want 
Ready? 3, 2, 1, go!
[chorus]
Speed freaks baby rocket dive 
I want to get on board before it rusts 
And when it flies it's the perfect rocket 
Come on space age baby rocket dive 
Bungee-dive in a place that can't be seen
[bridge]
A brand new star sparkles out into space 
Sail away
[verse]
No matter how many years we wait 
We'll be having lots of fun out in space 
Carry that missile in your heart and let's soar
[chorus]
Speed freaks baby rocket dive 
I want to fly to a place that can't be seen 
Your high-speed self starts quick a quick spark 
Come on speed freaks baby rocket dive 
Spread your wings and you can fly 
Say adios to those yesterdays filled with waiting
[outro]
A brand new star sparkles out into the world 
Sail away
