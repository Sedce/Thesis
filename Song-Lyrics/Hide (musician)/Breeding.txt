[intro]
In my skull, flying around 
With well matched faces, are two insects 
I don't mix with them, I don't understand them 
But I am consistent with them 

If I say red, the bugs insist on yellow 
If I say right, the bugs point east 
It's unbearable, we're indivisible 
I begin to spew lies [1] 

Unable to cross over with just a smile, I become a demon child 
Holding up the thorns, even beloved memories become all bloody [2] 

No matter how I try to tame the two insects 
It's water and oil, parallel lines that run on forever 
Appearing unpredictably 
They whisper in turn 

"That kid is great... break him down" 
"It'll only hurt you - just give up" [3] 
Those voices, in turn, 
Call out in my head 

Those two bugs are growing up inside my body 
Am I the one who's really being raised? 

Breed you treat me. I'll go on walking with the insects 
Breed you treat me. Destroying demons on the way 
Breed you treat me. We'll go on walking down this road 
Breed you treat me. If the insects disappear, I'll disappear too 

Hey master!! We've been inside you! 
Hey master!! Don't fuck with us! 
Hey busters!! You've been inside me! 
Hey busters!! Don't fuck with me! 

No matter how I try to tame the two insects 
It's water and oil, parallel lines that run on forever 
Appearing unpredictably 
They whisper in turn 

In my skull, flying around 
Well matched with me, are two insects 
When they whisper, I cannot defy them 
Am I being raised? 

Breed you treat me. I'll go on walking with the insects 
Breed you treat me. Destroying demons on the way 
Breed you treat me. We'll go on walking down this road 
Breed you treat me. If the insects disappear, I'll disappear too 

Hey master!! We've been inside you! 
Hey master!! Don't fuck with us! 
Hey busters!! You've been inside me! 
Hey busters!! Don't fuck with me!
