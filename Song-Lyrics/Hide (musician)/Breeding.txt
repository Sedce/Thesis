Flying around in my skull
Are two insects with look-alike faces
They don't understand each other, they don't interact
Yet, I am one with them

If one says Red, the other insists on Yellow
If one says Right, the other points to the East
They're inseparable, they're beyond my control
And so I spew lies

They turn into demon children when they can't get by on a smile (1)
They brandish their thorns and even my cherished memories are bloodied

Despite all my efforts to tame them
They parallel each other like water and oil
On a whim they appear
To whisper by turns

"My, what a hot chick...fuck her!"
"You'll only get hurt, please desist."
One by one, their voices
Scream inside my head

Within my body I'm raising two insects (2)
But in truth, aren't I the pet?

Breed you, treat me, with these insects I'll make my way
Breed you, treat me, as I try to evade these demons
Breed you, treat me, this path I will follow
Breed you, treat me, if the insects vanished, so would I

Hey master!! We've been inside you!
Hey master!! Don't fuck with us!
Hey busters!! You've been inside me!
Hey busters!! Don't fuck with me!

Despite all my efforts to tame them
They parallel each other like water and oil
On a whim they appear
To whisper by turns

Flying around in my skull
Are two insects, my look-alikes
If I obey when they whisper
Doesn't that make me their pet?

Breed you, treat me, with these insects I'll make my way
Breed you, treat me, as I try to evade these demons
Breed you, treat me, this path I will follow
Breed you, treat me, if the insects vanished, so would I

Hey master!! We've been inside you!
Hey master!! Don't fuck with us!
Hey busters!! You've been inside me!
Hey busters!! Don't fuck with me!
