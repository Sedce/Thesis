[verse]

Why do you stare?
Do you think that I care?
You've been misled
By the thoughts in your head

Your words waste and decay
Nothing you say
Reaches my ears anyway

You never spoke a word of truth

[verse]

Why do you think
I believe what you said?
Few of your words
Ever enter my head

I'm tired of hypocrite freaks
With tongues in their cheeks
Turning their eyes as they speak

They make me sick and tired
 

[bridge]

Are you confused
To the point
In your mind
Though you're blind
Can't you see you're wrong?

Won't you refuse
To be used
Even though
You may know
I can see you're wrong

[chorus]

Please, please, please open your eyes
Please, please, please don't give me lies

[verse]

I ruled all of the earth
Witnessed my birth
Cried at the sight of a man
And still I don't know who I am
 

[bridge]

Are you confused
To the point
In your mind
Though you're blind
Can't you see you're wrong?

Won't you refuse
To be used
Even though
You may know
I can see you're wrong

[chorus]

Please, please, please open your eyes
Please, please, please don't give me lies

[verse]

I've seen paupers as kings
Puppets on strings
Dance for the children who stare
You must've seen them everywhere
