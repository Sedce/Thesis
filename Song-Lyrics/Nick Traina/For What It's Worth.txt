[verse]
"You stay out of my way, or you'll pay.
Listen to what I say, how about I just go eat some hay?
I can make things out of clay, and lay by the bay. I just may! 
What d'ya say?"

There's something happening here,
What it is ain't exactly clear.
There's a man with a gun over there,
Telling me I've got to beware.

It's time we stop, hey, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going down.

Paranoia strikes deep,
Into your heart it will creep.
It happens when you're always afraid,
Step out of line, and the man come to take you away.

Stop, hey, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going down.

It's time we stop, hey, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going down.
Stop, hey, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going down.

You hippie fuckers!
