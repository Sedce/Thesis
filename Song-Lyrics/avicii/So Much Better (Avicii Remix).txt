[verse]
I tried my best that I could do
Just to find out I was never yours
I hang on to the words that you said
And I held out when my world was lost

[chorus]
'Cause I can do so
Yeah I can do so
Yeah I can do so much better
I can do so
I can do so
I can do so much better

[verse]
I tried my best that I could do
Just to find out I was never yours
I hang on to the words that you said
And I held out when my world was lost

[chorus]
Cause I can do so
Yeah, I can do so
Yeah, I can do so much better
I can do so
I can do so
I can do so much better

[chorus]
Cause I can do so
Yeah, I can do so
Yeah, I can do so much better
I can do so
I can do so
I can do so much better
