[chorus]
I'm Richie Dagger
I can stomp and swagger
I can take on all your heroes
I'm Richie Dagger
I'm young and i'm haggard
The boy that nobody owns

[verse]
He sits in his corner like a child despised
A crazy sort of cast comes over his eyes-
That's Richie Dagger's crime

He's that sort of boy that was never much loved
His idea of fun was society's grudge-
That's Richie Dagger's crime

His life was such a mess
And his friends weren't quite the best
But he was satisfied-
That's Richie Dagger's crime
Suck me in and spit me out
Devour me in haste-
[chorus]
I'm Richie Dagger
I can stomp and swagger
I can take on all your heroes
I'm Richie Dagger
I'm young and i'm haggard
The boy that nobody owns
 

He could set your mind ablaze
With sparkling eyes and visionary case
He stood like a remnant from an outbreak past
Wore something in his ear
And boy was he sass-
[chorus]
I'm Richie Dagger
I can stomp and swagger
I can take on all your heroes
I'm Richie Dagger
I'm young and i'm haggard
The boy that nobody owns
