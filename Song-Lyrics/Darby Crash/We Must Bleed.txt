It's Sunday and the streets aren't clear
The traffic's screaming
But we can't hear
The sounds, the metals
Driving us mad
The sounds, the metals
Driving us mad
The sounds, the metals
Driving us mad
Driving us mad, oh
Driving us mad
We must bleed, we must bleed
We must bleed, we must bleed

The crash as the bottle breaks
Flashes it will through my veins
The pain, the colors
Making me sane
The pain, the colors
Making me sane
The pain, the colors
Making me sane
The pain, the colors
Making me sane
We must bleed, we must bleed
We must bleed, we must bleed
 

I'm not one I'm two, I'm not one
I'm two, I'm not one I'm two
I want out now, I want out now
I want out now now now now now
Now now now...
