Standing in the line we're abberations
Defects in a defect's mirror
And we've been here all the time
Real fixations
Hidden deep in the furor-
What we do is secret-secret!

We're influential guys for the D.C.C
We can lie so perfect
And we've got a party line
To every call
It's a very short circuit-
What we do is secret-secret!

Licensed to drill with the torch
In our lives
Walking on shallow water
Progressed to the
Point of no distinction
Dementia of a higher order-
What we do is secret-secret!
