Looking for a way out
I put my foot out of line
Really like to break-out
I feel so confined

American leather
The poinsous members
Not alone-not together
Their American leather

Saw you on a dark road
Brought myself along
Got a sense of conflict
But I know what's wrong

(Chorus)
(Middle)

(Chorus)
I know that kinda feeling
So I built my place up high
But you'll never find me kneeling
Cause I'm too occupied

(Chorus)
