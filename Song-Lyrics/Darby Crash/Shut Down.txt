Shut Down
(Annihilation Man) (9:39)
Let me touch the tips of inculcated desire
And brush the fettered veil away
Shut down in the depths I lay...
If you want nothin' then I've got nothin'
I'm your annihilation man
Lemme get control I've got your minds
Now I want
Your souls, lemme get control
I've got your minds
Now I want control, I need control...
If you want somethin' then
I've got somethin'
I'm your annihilation man...
