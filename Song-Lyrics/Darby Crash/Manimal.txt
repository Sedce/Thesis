I came into this world like a puzzled panther
Wanting to be caged
But something stood in the way
I was never quite tamed

I crossed the paths of right and wrong -
And saw them take their toll
I saw armies that marched
And like animals they crawled

I came into this world like a puzzled panther
Wanting to be caged
But something stood in the way
I was never quite tamed

Evolution is a process too slow
To save my soul
But I've got this creature on my back
And it just won't let go

If I am only an animal
Then I can do no wrong
But they say I'm something better
So I've gotta hold on
