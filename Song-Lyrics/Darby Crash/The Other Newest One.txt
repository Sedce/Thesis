[verse]
I feel your body's close to mine
I hear your breath and mine in time
I know I'm nothing but it's you that I need
I touch your skin and it starts to feed
You're not the first you're not the last
Another day another crash
[chorus]
My eyes meet yours in secret glance
Our bodies look in ancient stance
You whisper something and I know it's good
You're acting crazy just like I knew you would

You're not the first you're not the last
Another day another crash
[verse]
Embracing my life between your thighs
We will perform in the deadly skies
Reducing my mind to endless nights
You send my dreams to their demise
Realized by your last breath

I take your hair into my hands
I pull it tight to fill your demands
I feed my body into yours
I know it's right cause that's my soul you stir

You're not the first you're not the last
Another day another crash
