I'm looking through
Communist eyes
I'm seeing planes in bloodshot skies
I see the flag of a working people
Who conceal the lies in the stars
And sickle
It's a double edge

Communist eyes-c'mon inside
I can't ever find the way out
Communist eyes-lost inside
I never get a day out

I'm looking through Communist eyes
All I see is an old man's alibi
There's a world outside
But I'm unaware
I open my books but the pages stare
It's a double edge

Communist eyes-all so blind
I can't even play the game now

I'm living through Communist times
I wave my flag and hold me head high
I can feel the glory of my
Comrades in masses
But I'm waiting for the day
When this madness passes
It's a double edge...
