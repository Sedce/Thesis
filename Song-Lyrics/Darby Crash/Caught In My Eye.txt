[verse]
Though your dark eyes
You can feel my
Every sin
When I walk right
Into a straight line
This world of yours
I got you caught in my eye, again
[chorus]
You're the fall guy
In the corner
Of my gloom
It feels like
Everything I see
Is nothing new
I got you caught in my eye, again
[verse]
There's a door there
That opens
Without you
And the door lies
With its open keys
To my room
[outro]
Flames of the torch light
Fill my thighs
And I crave fulfill
And I consume 'em
But I don't give
I got you caught in my eye, again
