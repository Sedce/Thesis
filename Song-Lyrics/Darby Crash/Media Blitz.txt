[chorus]
I've got television
I've got supervision
No decisons for you
Media blitz-media blitz
Immediate hits-we rule
[verse]
Don't steal your eyes off the TV screen
Can you realize we're what we've seen
Take an injection from the mad machine
Don't read the papers read between the lines
We're vision rapers and we seed the signs
You'll play your part in the master mind
[bridge]
We feed the science
We deal in riots
We play by ideal time
We're a gov'ment fix
All social convicts
Watch the idle rhymes
[chorus]
I've got television
I've got supervision
No decisons for you
Media blitz-media blitz
[outro]
Bleed your heart out-that's all it's worth
Before you ever start-we planned it first
Forget the truth-accept your curse
