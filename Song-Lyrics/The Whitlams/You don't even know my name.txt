[intro]
I've been watchin' you
For so long now

You know I feel just

A little ashamed
[verse]
You know I follow you

Wherever you go

Hoping one day

Things might change
[chorus]


Maybe someday you will notice me

And this won't be just a game


You know I've seen every show

You've ever done

[bridge]
You don't even know my name

You don't even know my name


[chorus]
Maybe Monday hopefully someday

Yeah all my luck will change

'Til then I'll just follow you

Wherever you go

[outro]
You don't even know my name

You don't even know my name
