[intro]
The light from the street it comes

Filtering through your room

Just another night just another dream you're putting yourself into

And outside the streets are bare without a care as if no-one

[verse]
Dares to make a sound

I said well ain't that the way

That you like it


Well I know with all the plans we had it was gonna be hard to succeed

But harder than any of that is sitting here watching you bleed


[chorus]
You're on a plane to the end of your world

You're going down down down
It's one hell of a way to go out


Yeah and all around it's comin' down

You feel the winter it's setting in

[bridge]
Well the leaves they now fill the gutters

The trees just branches in the wind


And into an empty room my eyes they're open wide

To try to find something that was inside

To take the place of what was left behind


[chorus]
You're on a plane to the end of your world

You're going down down down

It's one hell of a way to go out
 


Well you know it's so quiet here

It's like a country town
Where all the drama's gone

It's left far behind and now there's only piece of mind

[outro]

You never thought it was a crime

To be so sad and lonely

But now you're down down down

It's one hell of a way to go out

Out with a bang
