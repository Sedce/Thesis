[intro]
(One two three four)

[verse]
Back on the coast of Wales to trace my people

I came upon a tombstone with my name

And as I lay down my rose

I knew I was not alone

Red hair and green eyes were watchin' me

She took me to her home to play her sweet music

And sitting by her fire I took her in

She was singin' soft and low

I heard an echo in my soul

Like something I had left here a long time ago
[chorus]

In the old country
Fiddle and a fife

Songs about love, songs about life

In the old country, country

Like the blood in my veins

Thunder in the meadow

Like the lightning on the plains

On the plains

She took me by the hand to see the great churches

And the taverns where the old men sit and lie

And it warmed me to my bones

Like a photograph of home

That some things are the same

No matter where you go


[chorus]
In the old country

Fiddle and a fife

Songs about love, songs about life

In the old country, country

Like the blood in my veins
Thunder in the meadow

Lightning on the plains

On the plains

Li li li la la la li li li li li li
Li li li la la la li li li li li li


[outro]
In the old country

Fiddle and a fife

Songs about love, songs about life

In the old country, country

Like the blood in my veins

Thunder in the meadow

Lightning on the plains
