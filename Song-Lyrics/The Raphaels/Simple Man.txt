[chorus]
I'm a simple man, want a simple life

I want a paid up home, I want a faithful wife

I don't need much money to keep me free

Just need the love of you for me

I'm a simple man, had a simple plan

I got a complicated life


Ain't got no time to call my own

I'm wearing out my telephone

[verse]
I hear the whispers behind my back

I'm trying hard, but things look black


I'm a simple man, had a simple plan

I got a complicated life

[bridge]
Sometimes when you smile,
It makes the whole thing seem worthwhile
Sometimes when you smile,
It leads me down that final mile

[verse]
That lets a simple man lead a complicated life

I take one step forward it's like two steps back

I may be weary, but my soul's intact

Forever chasing what I can't reach

Forever pacing life's stony beach

[outro]
I'm a simple man, had a simple plan

I got a complicated life

Sometimes when you smile,
It makes the whole thing seem worthwhile
Sometimes when you smile,
It leads me down that final mile

That lets a simple man lead a complicated life
