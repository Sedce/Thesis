[intro]
Put down all of my defense

I gave myself without pretence

You were sharpening your words for the offence

I am caught in friendly fire

[verse]
Hanging here on your barbed wire

In surrender to the cause of your desire


If making love is making war

I wonder who I'm fighting for

[bridge]
But my wounds will heal on our private battlefield

I thought that you were on my side

Now I need a place to hide

[chorus]
'Till the dust has cleared on our private battlefield

La da da da


There's the dream, and there's the truth

There's a question, and the proof

Time to fight, time to lie down and call a truce

We all believe we have a cause

We put our trust in faith and law

'Till we find out in the end that no one wins, but...


Making love is making war

I wonder who I'm fighting for

But my wounds will heal on our private battlefield

I thought that you were on my side

Now I need a place to hide

'Till the dust has cleared on our private battlefield

La da da mmm

[verse]
There's no use in me pretending I'm not scared

You caught me cold and unaware

But I pray someday that peace may reign

On our private battlefield


If making love is making war

I wonder who I'm fighting for

But my wounds will heal on our private battlefield

I thought that you were on my side

Now I need a place to hide

[outro]
'Till the dust has cleared on our private battlefield
La da da da
