I'm a bee charmer for you baby
Get you honey if you've got the taste
A little sting now and then well, it does not bother me, no
Don't mind no queen bee on my face
Go with you anyway the wind blows
Straight through the fire into the unknown
Follow the feelings, 'cause I know
It's supernatural, supernatural

I'm a snake handler from the mountains
Sing them rattlers off to sleep, yeah
Ooh, if my baby she needs healing
No fever too hot, no cut too deep
Go with you anyway the wind blows
Straight through the fire into the unknown
Follow the feelings, 'cause I know
It's supernatural, supernatural

I'm a rain maker in the desert
Dance and I coax those clouds to cry
Put the bloom back in baby's meadow
And I, I flood the faith, flood the faith back into your eyes
Go with you anyway the wind blows
Straight through the fire into the unknown
Follow the feelings, 'cause I know
Its supernatural

Go with you anyway the wind blows
Straight through the fire into the unknown
Follow the feelings, 'cause I know
It's supernatural, supernatural
Oh, supernatural
