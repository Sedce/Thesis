[intro]
(One two three four)

[verse]
You could smell the sea on his working clothes

I'd take his rough hands, and I wouldn't let go

Son, if ships don't sail, then our table's bare
[chorus]
And I'm not alone out there

Got to grow up fast, when you don't have a choice

When the table's bare, and there's no father's voice

Smell his working clothes on the cold salt air

And I'm not alone out there

No, I'm not alone out there

[verse]
We are cast adrift on an endless storm

Many dreams will come and wash overboard

But we will not mourn, what we have not lost

We will learn to row with the oars

We have got

[bridge]
For the waves may die, but the sea remains

Nets disappear in the deep again

Lifting life for all to share

[chorus]
And we're not alone out there

We are not alone out there


We are cast adrift on an endless storm

Many dreams will come and wash overboard

But we will not mourn, what we have not lost

We will learn to row with the oars

We are cast adrift 
(We cast adrift)

[verse]
On an endless storm (On the storm)

Many dreams will come and wash overboard (Many dreams)

But we will not mourn, (We will not mourn)

What we have not lost

[outro]
We will learn to row with the oars

We have got

We will learn to row with those oars

We will learn to row, ooh

We will learn to row with the oars we've got
