[intro]
I took my past out for a ride

Along the North Sea

All my demons in the back seat

Crying out for me

[verse]
Time to pay the piper, time to call in a marker

Time to cough it up

The last thing on my mind

Was another shot at love



[chorus]
Too many, too many, too many ghosts

One too many ghosts to fall in love


Avarice and drunkenness

Pride and infidelity

[verse]
I left them off at a bus stop

Along the coast


You brushed past from nowhere

And you sat right up front with me
[bridge]

You were looking like a virgin

Unconfirmed, waiting for the host

But there are no virgins here

No novices

No innocence

Just the dark desire for forgiveness


[chorus]
Too many, too many, too many ghosts

One too many ghosts to fall in

Too many, too many, too many ghosts

One too many ghosts to fall in love

I took my new love out for a ride

Along the North Sea

[verse]
Forgiveness or forgetfulness

It's all the same to me


And as I stare into her eyes

And press her in my arms

I look over her shoulder

And there my demons are
[outro]

Too many, too many, too many ghosts

One too many ghosts to fall in

Too many, too many, too many ghosts

One too many ghosts to fall in love
