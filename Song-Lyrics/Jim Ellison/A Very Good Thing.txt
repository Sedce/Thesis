Do you remember the time
I remember the time
Like a boyhood nursery rhyme
Just a voice inside my head
Trying to get out

Do you remember the way
Well I remember the way
Like a night turned into day
Well I dressed you up
And your mother threw you back down

And when I feel I can't go on
I turn the radio on
It's a good thing
It's a good thing
It's a good, good, good
Very good thing that you're gone

Do you remember the voice
Yeah I remember the voice
And it gave me no choice
It was several of them
And I had to take one out

I remember the time
Yeah I remember the time
Like a high school nursery rhyme
And I pushed you in
And I pushed you down
 

And when I feel I can't go on
I turn the radio on
It's a good thing
It's a good thing (It's a very good)
Good, good, good
Very good thing that you're gone

And when I feel I can't go on
I turn the radio on
It's a good thing
It's a good thing (It's a very good)
Good, good, good
Very good thing that you're gone

And when I feel I can't go on
I turn the radio on
It's a good thing
It's a good thing
It's good, good, good
Very good thing that you're gone
