[verse]
She's got a brand new car
We're playin the radio way too loud
Wants me to grow to be some kind of cult star
There's too much time for that right now
[chorus]
She's Goin' Thru My Head
She's Goin' Thru My Head
My Head
My Head
My Head
My Head
[verse]
She's playin my very most favourite sweet record
And her dad just loves my long brown hair
He's buyin me a brand new leather jacket man!
I dont remember what it was like to care
[chorus]
She's Goin' Thru My Head
She's Goin' Thru My Head
My Head
My Head
My Head
My Head
[bridge]
He's got a brand new cadillac car
Were playin his 8 track way too loud
Wants me to grow up to be some kind of pop star
Theres too much time for that shit now
[chorus]
She's Goin' Thru My Head
She's Goin' Thru My Head
My Head
My Head
My Head
My Head
