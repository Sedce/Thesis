In all headlines of the day
N'wonder what these papers want to say
With news that only take you away
From your own thoughts in new taxes to pay
As long as these people don't smile
All these news are just a waste of time
So no use for you to hesitate
'cause in the end you're just another piece of cake

The wounds that bother you in the past
Will follow you as long as you let them last
They were all just lessons for today
N'if you don't learn I'm sure they'll come again
We cannot move forwards if we're stuck in this
Madness of bringing yesterday in today
N'it's all just a question of putting it all together
And taking it as a lesson for today
So no use for you to hesitate
'cause in the end you're just another piece of cake

No don't hesitate ...
'cause in the end you're just another piece of cake

And when the King's tone starts to speak
Don't fear you're just about to get the key
