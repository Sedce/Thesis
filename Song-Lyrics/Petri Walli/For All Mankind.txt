We all know this worlds' going through some big changes
It gets to the point where all phenomenon seem crazy
People start looking for ways to live outside
From the system that makes them all so blind
Some try to find new fields to explore from outside
Their heads some go in there and find that
The richness of life is so easy to multiply
Just by throwing away all the thoughts that keep us
From learning to know the personality
That lives inside us
And tries to come out
But facing it is the key to unwind
From closing yourself as the surroundings provide

Look out world it's time to die
No more crying with my mind
Some of us have seen the sign
The promise of a balanced time
When we'll sing no lullabies
And all of us have got real eyes
The shamen seeds for all mankind

One day we will say goodbye
To all of them who live the time
No more need to compromise
No more questions: "tell me why"
This balanced heart needs no disguise
But shamen seeds for all mankind
The shamen seeds for all mankind
