[intr]Welcome to the mirrorland where we all
Understand the time is now and around is just
Memories and premises
So live now or to live outside the present time
Present, that's nice, when you give you allways get
Back but when you take...?
The mirrorland
It's got lessons and lessons and prizes in
Between
The mirrorland
It's got history and it's got his story
In the mirrorland
As we pile now the things we used to feel before
We get close to his presence who tells where to
Go it's that first sound you get before you think
About it at all
Afet that comes the one(*) that's reduced and it's
Gone
Could it be so that all the answers are there
All it takes is the peace to hear what it says
