Try to work across the fields to touch the trees behind it
Something made me go there and while I just had to find it
The ground was very sinking so I figured I'd lay down
Close my eyes and felt the mud
Right under my back bone

A toad with such a smell they woke me up and asked me friendly:
Have you seen the sandman, see I haven't slept for ten days
- "No I haven't seen him, but have you asked the pygmies?
They gave me herbs to cure me out, now I see some weird things .."

Let's go see the tiny folks when the moon is shining
Meet you there across the crane
I think I must be dying
"Have you touched the trees across the fields?", they were all smiling
- "Go back there and touch the trees, if you still can find there .."
