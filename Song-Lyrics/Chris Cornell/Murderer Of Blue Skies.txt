[verse]
You flew in on the wind
Was a day that I won't forget
Told me to let you in
And that I would not regret it
But you had a touch as cool as rain
And only once the weather changed
Murderer of blue skies
[chorus]
I can't wait
To never be with you again
And I can't wait
To lead a life that you're not in
And I won't break
Though I may bend
From time to time
I can't wait to never be with you again
[verse]
Now, the truth will set you free
But all you had was lying in you
So you built a cage for me
All the while pretending to be
A living saint with a thorny crown
And me condemned to be your clown
I applaud you as you take a bow
[chorus]
I can't wait
To never be with you again
And I can't wait
To lead a life that you're not in
And I won't break
Though I may bend
From time to time
I can't wait to never be with you
[bridge]
Always thought that I pride myself on patience
But it's wearing thin
Never thought that falling for you only meant
Falling down
[chorus]
I can't wait
To never be with you again
And I can't wait
To lead a life that you're not in
And I won't break
Though I may bend
[chorus]
I can't wait
To never be with you again
And I can't wait
To lead a life that you're not in
And I won't break
Though I may bend
From time to time
I can't wait to never be with you again
I can't wait to never be with you again
