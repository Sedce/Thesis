[verse]
Night falls while drunken angels
Sleep by the side of the road
And I'm nodding in a stairwell
Just trying to stay out of the cold
[chorus]
Circling around the drain
Can't find my way back to home
The road is long
And never ends
Dark is the heart that wanders
[verse]
Light breaks in through the window
Takes a minute to know where I am
A dying blackbird
Gives her soul to the wind
On the roof of the house
That I can see from the bed
[chorus]
Circling around the drain
Show me the way back home
The road is long
It never ends
Dark is the heart that wanders
[verse]
I'd crawl a hundred thousand miles
Just to see your two eyes look me over
I'd steal you flowers in the bloodshot light
Of the lonely hours on a moonless night

Just like a stray dog in the rain
I can run all night and get nowhere
I picture you out underneath the porch light
Calling my name all night
And waiting for me

I thought I heard your voice in the water
As I walked by a fountain uptown
Now I'm an orphaned at the door of church
Just watching the water come down
[verse]
Circling around the drain
Hope that I make it home
I never felt so far away
Dark is the heart
That wanders.
