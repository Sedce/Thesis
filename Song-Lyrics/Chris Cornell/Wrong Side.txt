[verse]
When I was just a boy of ten
My father met a miner’s death
Trapped inside through twenty nights
No one made it out alive
So there I was alone but free
The master of my destiny
And trouble found me right away
My close companions since that day
[chorus]
And I’m on the side of the road again
I’m on the wrong side my friend
Whichever way the wind is blowing
No matter where the river bends
I'm on the side of wrong again
[verse]
At 21 I fell in love
To a girl of 16 years
But a jealous father ran me down
Left me in the road for dead
So I decided there and then
I’d find the car, I’d take revenge
But the fire caught the house and fields
I haven’t slept a whole night since
[chorus]
And I’m on the side of wrong again
I’m on the wrong side my friend
Whichever way the wind is blowing
No matter where the river bends
I’m on the side alone again
I’m on the side of wrong again
[bridge]
I ran three years and finally stopped
Cut my hair and found a job
Working in a road café
Sleeping in the parking lot
Late one night the store was robbed
The owner dead his boy was shot
And I’m the only one he sold
Now I’m waiting for the trap door to drop
[chorus]
And I’m on the side of the road again
I’m on the wrong side my friend
Whichever way the wind is blowing
No matter where the river bends
I’m on the side alone again
I’m on the side of wrong again
I’m on the side of wrong again
