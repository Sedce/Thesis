[verse]
Time ain’t nothing if it ain’t fast
Taking everything that you ever had
And giving nothing in return
But a cold bed in the quiet earth

[bridge]
If there's a door to every cell
A pearl inside of every shell, then

[chorus]
How hard can it be
To share your life with me?
How hard can it be
To rise with me each morning
I know that it feels like
We will live forever, but I fear
That time will hide the years

[verse]
Life ain’t nothing if it ain’t hard
It’ll show you who you truly are
Knock you down when you get too tall
Till you spun around in a free fall

[bridge]
But somewhere out there past the storm
Lies the shelter of your heart
 

[chorus]
So how hard can it be
To share your life with me?
How hard can it be
To rise with me each morning
I know that it feels like
We will live for ever, but I fear
That time can hide the years
Like we were never here
So hold on tightly my dear

[bridge]
I'm not one to waste my time
Searching for some silver lining
Somewhere out there past the storm
Lies the shelter
Of your heart

[chorus]
So how hard can it be (how hard)
To share your life with me?
How hard can it be
To rise with me each morning
I know that it feels like
We will live forever, but I fear
That time can hide the years
Like we were never here
So hold on tightly my dear
 

[outro]
Before we disappear
Before we disappear
