Time ain't nothing if it ain't fast
Taking everything that you ever had
And giving nothing in return
But a cold bed in a quiet earth

If there's a door to every cell
A pearl inside of every shell then

How hard can it be
To share your love with me?
How hard can it be
To rise with me each morning?
I know that it feels like
We will live forever
But I fear
That time will hide the years

Life ain't nothing if it ain't hard
It'll show you who you truly are
Knock you down when you get too tall
Till you're spun around in a free fall

But somewhere out there past the storm
Lies the shelter of your heart

So how hard can it be
To share your love with me?
How hard can it be
To rise with me each morning?
I know that it feels like
We will live for ever
But I fear
That time can hide the years
So hold on tightly my dear

I'm not one to waste my time
Searching for some silver lining
But somewhere out there past the storm
Lies the shelter
Of your heart

So how hard can it be (how hard)
To share your love with me?
How hard can it be
To rise with me each morning?
I know that it feels like
We will live forever
But I fear
That time can hide the years
Like we were never here
So hold on tightly my dear

Before we disappear
Before we disappear
