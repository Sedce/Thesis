[verse]
In a castle
Down a long road
A little girl was born
To a king and
To a queen and
Her mother’s eyes welled up with tears of joy
Staring at the tiny face
Of a miracle she made
She would say I love you
She would say I love you

Summer came and went
Unrolling trees all stripped to the bone
Daddy’s little girl in his arms, well
They sit upon his throne
Who is that thief hiding in the dark
Just a little girl who stole his heart
[chorus]
He would say I love you
He would say I love you
He would say I love you

[verse]
With only these three words repeating
A simple greeting but it’s all you keep
Clever lips can be misleading
A tongue can fly away
And won’t come back
But it’s only these words we recognize

6 o’clock A.M
The alarm rings out
Awoken from the dream
No more castle down a long road
No more kings and no more queens
But she’s a princess none the less
And a handsome prince is what she’ll get
[chorus]
He will say I love you
He will say I love you
He will say I love you
He will say I love you
He will say I love you
