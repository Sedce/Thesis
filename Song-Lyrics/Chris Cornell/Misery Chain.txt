[intro]
Won't you take one link, from this misery chain.
Keep it to remind you, of a long forgotten time or a place.
So that you recognize its shape, when it's near.
Any time or place this misery chain should appear.
[verse]
Take the locks and shackles, and melt all of it down.
Shine a light upon, every shadow, every acre of ground.
The hidden corners on in all around
Anyway you feel this misery chain should be found.
[chorus]
When we're gone, and it's all said and done.
What will we leave.
Stories told, will they speak of us when God only knows
That those word will be.
[verse]
And if I should fall, from the top of the world
To the depths below, so far below where our believe could exist.
Down further still will be, the one who hides the key.
And there's to try to put these misery chains on me.
[chorus]
When we're gone, and it's all said and done.
What will we leave.
Stories told, will they speak of us when God only knows
That those word will be.
[outro]
Won't you take one link, from this misery chain.
Keep it to remind you, of a long forgotten time or a place.
So that you recognize it, 'till it's understood.
And that every trace of this misery chain is gone for good.
'til every trace of this misery chain is gone for good.
