Worried moon shining bright
Can I sleep here tonight right beside you?
I got a long way to go
I'll be off in the morning
And I hope but I don't know
If she will have me back again
Or only want me for a friend
And leave a stain across my heart
That never washes out

Nervous moon
In the clouds
There's a halo around your proud face
And I'm glad that we're friends
I might see you again
Sooner or later, I guess

Yeah if it all goes wrong
And I'm a heart without a home
Maybe you can talk me out
Of doing myself in

Worried moon
I'm afraid of what's to come
Worried moon
Yeah, tell me what you know
Worried moon
You see further down the road
Worried moon

There you are, looking down
I'll be here on the ground if you need me
As I dream of a ghost
Of a love that has died

Or maybe not but it haunts me now

Worried moon
I'm afraid of what's to come
Worried moon
Yeah, tell me what you know
Worried moon
You see further down the road
Worried moon

Looking up, you are gone
I got into the city at midnight
All these eyes looking on
Make me blind or put me down
And the noise just drowns me out

Worried moon
I'm afraid of what's to come
Worried moon
Yeah, tell me what you know
Worried moon
You see further down the road
Worried moon

Dirty moon on the rise
Orange as fire but a bitter cold
You'll remember me I know
'Cause I have moved to another coast
With a new love to call my own
Maybe one day you can bathe us
In your blue light
Worried moon
Worried moon
