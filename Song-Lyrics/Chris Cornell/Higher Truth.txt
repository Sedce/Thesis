[verse]
You can make somebody cry
Go on
Do what you like
I’ll be there by your side
I know
What the future holds

You can set the world on fire
Yeah if you want
It isn’t hard
I won’t be there looking on
To see the trail of lies
As you fall
[choru]
But I’ll take the truth
The higher truth
The higher truth
I want the truth
The higher truth
The higher truth
[verse]
You can fill the world with pain
Yeah if you want
I've seen it now
You can fill the world with hate
I’ve seen it done before
And I know how it all works out

Make a promise if you can
You know
You’ll only break it
Make a promise if you dare
Go on right ahead
And let’s see where it gets you
[chorus]
But I’ll take the truth
The higher truth
The higher truth
I want the truth
The higher truth
The higher truth
[bridge]
Maybe you and I one day
Will finally choose
A higher truth
[verse]
Come let’s sit in the sun
Feel the world spin around
As the birds fly overhead
Can’t you hear the waves
Can’t you feel the rain
As it falls upon your face
[chorus]
I’ll take a truth
A higher truth
A higher truth
I want the truth
The higher truth
A higher truth
[verse]
I’ll take a truth
A higher truth
A higher truth
I want the truth
The higher truth
A higher truth
[bridge]
Maybe you and I one day will finally choose
The higher truth
[outro]
Can’t you feel the higher
Can’t you feel the higher
As it falls around?
