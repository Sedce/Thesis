[verse]
Josephine where can you be now?
Again the sun is rising on my troubled heart
Don’t deny you know you and I
Are the making of what fate
Just can’t pull apart
[chorus]
My sweet Josephine
Won’t you come and marry me?
I got every kind of love that you would ever need
Dying here on bended knees
[bridge]
Sheets of rain
Cold and gray
Run down the page
Just about your name
With just the weight of your silent smile
Crashing all around me while i screamed it out loud
[chorus]
My sweet Josephine
Won’t you come and marry me?
I got every kind of love that you would ever need
Dying here on bended knees
[verse]
Like a raven in a cage
Blood on my birth
Just won’t wash away
Like a stitched together doll
My feet to the flame
As I follow the blame
For someone else’s pain
For someone else’s pain
[bridge]
Rivers of black ink flood
A tapestry of flesh and blood around my frame
A living shrine just for you of human mind
Golden band upon your hand
Leave this endless winter behind
[chorus]
My sweet josephine
Won’t you come and marry me?
I got every single kind of love that you would ever need
Dying here on bended knees
Dying here on bended knees
Dying here on bended knees
My Josephine
