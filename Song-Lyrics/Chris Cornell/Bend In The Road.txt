In a bend in the road
I知 too lost and tired
To see where I知 going
What I left behind
And I知 moving
So slow
Don稚 know when I値l arrive
So put a bend in the road
I知 growing tired
Of straight lines

I set off for the shore
And I finally slipped away
From the ones i adored
And the place i was raised
And I rode down the road
Just to watch it go by
And when and where is love?
Maybe nowhere tonight

Everyone needs a touch
Or a shoulder for crying
The say love is a crutch
I say love is blind
And that痴 all that she needed
But I could not supply
When a bend in the road
Put it out of my mind

There was a strange little girl
Who was everything I ever dreamed
I could love or be loved by

So put a bridge
Or a hill
Or a forest of pines
Or a river of blue
I can run along side
I値l sleep when it痴 night
I follow all the signs
Just put a bend in the road
I知 growing tired of straight lines
Put a bend in the road
I知 growing tired of straight lines
