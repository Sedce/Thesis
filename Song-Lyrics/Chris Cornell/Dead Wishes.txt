[verse]
Staring in the mirror with two borrowed eyes
Looking for the part of me that's still alive
Waiting for my chest to fall and rise
Standing on the corner With my shirt tucked in
Summer turns to autumn winter turns to spring
And it all flies by like a speeding train
[chorus]
Dead wishes on a broken chain
White roses in a dead man's dream
Down and out with everything to lose
If these long dead wishes
Ever do come true
[verse]
Waiting for the night to come and chase away
All the flies hovering around my head
With my memory for a pillow
And all my regrets for a bed

Standing on the corner now I'm passed surprise
Yelling out a warning to some passer by
I stand just as God made me
And I lie down in disguise
[chorus]
Dead wishes on a burning lake
White roses from my soul to keep
Down and out with everything to win
If my long since sunken ship
Ever does come in
(Round and round we all fall down
And that's how ancient mountains crumble)
[outro]
Time keeps moving slower
Like falling from the sun
Come and knock me over
I keep getting up
Throw a line down to me
Keep hanging on
[verse]
Standing on the corner don't apologize
You don't have to bow your head or raise your eyes
Or pretend that you don't see me
[chorus]
Dead wishes on a broken chain
White roses in a dead man's dream
Down and out with everything to lose
If these long dead wishes
Ever do come true

(Round and round we all fall down
And that's how ancient mountains crumble)
