[Verse 1]
These endless days are wait for me
Tearing my heart that breaks for you
I'm coming home tomorrow
Though you're not lying next to me
I hear your song that calls to me
I'm coming home tomorrow
Back in your arms

[Chorus]
Tomorrow's just a dream I can't detain
It's like a fall I can't contain
And though it seems so far away
It's just a day, a lonely day away

[Verse 2]
The summer's gone and I can see
The season's end is set me free
I'm coming home tomorrow
Back in your arms

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Tomorrow I'm coming home [x2]
I'm so tired and so alone
 

[Chorus]
It's like a dream I can't detain
It's like a fall I can't contain
And though it seems so far away
It's just a day, a lonely day away
