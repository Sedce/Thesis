[verse]
Aww, she didn't bat an eye
As I packed my bags to leave
Thought she would start to cry
Stood around on my room and grieve
[bridge]
Y'all, the girl, she fooled me this time
She acted like I was the last thing on her mind
Girl, I'd like to start all over again
[chorus]
Baby, can I change my mind?
[verse]
As I took those steps
Towards that open door
Knowing all the time
Oh, Lord, I just didn't wanna go

She didn't give me no sign
Nothing that would make me change my mind
Now, I'd like to start all over again
[chorus]
Baby, can I change my mind?
Please, please, please baby
I just wanna change my mind
[verse]
Lord, I played my games
Many times before
But peoples, let me tell y'all
Oh, I never reached the door
[bridge] 
Cool wind is  tonight
Keep lookin' back but my baby was not in sight
And I'd like to start all over again
[chorus]
Baby, let me change my mind
Feeling gloomy, baby
That's how I can't change my mind
