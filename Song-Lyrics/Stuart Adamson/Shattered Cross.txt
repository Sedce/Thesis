You don't mess around with a man in black
You say something wrong that you can't take back
You go for a ride in his automobile
The spot in the woods just over the hill
No, you don't mess around with a man in black
You don't fool around with a woman in red
You wake up alone in a cold barren bed
She'll empty your pockets and rip out your heart
And leave you with ruins of a life torn apart
No, you don't fool around with a woman in red
You never make deals with a guy named Doc
You'll have a gun in your hands by 12 o'clock
And if the sodium lights with your heart in your throat
Your life won't amount to a bottle of smoke
No, you never make deals with a guy named doc

Don't bring me your tales of temptation and loss
The rags of your dreams, your shattered cross
I've heard your confession, I know who you blame
If you had it all back you'd just lose it again
You can bank on redemption if you're insane
So don't bring me your tales of temptation and loss
Oh don't bring me the pieces of your shattered cross
