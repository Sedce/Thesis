[verse]
You'll make the scene
Like you always do
Going upstream
Down the avenue
To fuck some trophy boy
That you'll win tonight at the bar

[bridge]
So bad, so far
You'll make him sad
Shooting star

[verse]
When it was me
I was momentarily proud
Drunk on dreams
Now I'm glad I didn't say out loud
You said you'd be for real
But I don't believe that you are

[bridge]
So bad, so far
You make me sad
Shooting star
 

[bridge]
You're distant and cold
And a sight to behold
Everybody just sighs

But no one gets on
With you very long
Cause you don't feel bad when you lie

[verse]
I'm going to sleep now
Going back to find square one
Square two be where
I can deal with the shit you just done
It won't be soon
Say the least it's gonna be hard

[outro]
So bad, so far
Your love is sad
Shooting star

Your love is sad
Shooting star
