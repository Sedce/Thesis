[verse]
I met a girl, snowball in hell
She was hard and as cracked as the Liberty Bell
I got her to come on and move in with me
And I said I'd find a better place we could spend eternity

[chorus]
Don't go down
Don't go down
Stay with me
Baby stay

[verse]
Her mama called me a thief
And her dad called himself commander-in-chief
I fought him off with my love
But I knew the sense of worthlessness she'd have to rise above

[chorus]
Don't go down
Don't go down
Stay with me
Baby stay
Don't go down
Don't go down
Stay with me
Baby stay

[verse]
She had a dream, woke up in shock
She had seen her own body outlined in chalk
I split the scene, the globe'd been spun
And her ghost leaned down to kiss me
With a message from the sun
[chorus]
Don't go down
Don't go down
Stay with me
Baby stay
[outro]
Don't go down
Stay with me
Baby stay

Don't go down
Stay with me
Baby stay
