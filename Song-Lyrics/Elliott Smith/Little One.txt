[intro]
One more, little one
I'll go down
Stay down
Sleep the rest of the day
[bridge]
Dream new
Music to calm down
Stay down
And keep evil away
[chorus]
I can hear you asleep
Changing your shape
Dissolved in some dream
As a new one appears
To take you along
Where you've never been
[bridge]
One, two
Three, four, five
Six, seven
[verse]
The moonlight tonight
Seems to belong to me
Cause I
Even those who can’t sleep (Never go to sleep)
They need some company
 

One hit
Wouldn't hurt a bit at all
Slow down (Stay down)
See what’s there to find (See what’s there today)

If it's (If it’s)
Good shit you won't know (gonna be)
And I won't know (ok)
The fact that I'm dying (all done)

If I seem to be reckless with myself
It's the fault of no one
All things have a place
Under the moon
As well as the sun
[outro]
One more
Little one, I love you
