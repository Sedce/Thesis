[verse]
Yeah
Everything I ever wanted finally came to me
But in the end it wasn't what I wanted it to be
I wagered everything I had and never had a doubt
Only to discover it ain't what it's all about
I know I'm wrong
Been gone too long
I'm goin' home for good
[chorus]
When I wake up in the morning and I head on down the road
I regret the feelings that I never showed
And every time I try to think of reasons why to walk away
I can only find a reason not run
She's the one
[verse]
Seems you always hurt the ones you really love the most
Giving up the girl instead of giving up the ghost
If I could do it all again I'd do it differently
‘Cause everything that I did wrong is right in front of me
I know it's time
To make her mine
I know my aim is true
[chorus]
When I wake up in the morning and I head on down the road
I regret the feelings that I never showed
And every time I try to think of reasons why to walk away
I can only find a reason not run
She's the one
