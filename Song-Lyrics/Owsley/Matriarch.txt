[intro]
I see Christine Avenue every night
Through the kitchen down the hallway
To the bedroom on the right
I slide in my easy chair
[verse]
Safe as can be
To the eyes of adoration
Simply starring back at me
To say
Everything in life is gonna be okay
[chorus]
Matriarch of the family
More than a reverie
You were a friend to me
Sometimes I cry out for my Joan of Arc
To come back and lead the march
Gone is my Matriarch
[verse]
I remember how the seats felt in her 225
And I can hear the engine purring as it pulls into the drive
She'd pick me up and take me down to Dawn's five and ten
And let me change my mind a thousand times
And take me home again
So cool
Wrote me letters everyday when I was off at school
[chorus]
Matriarch of the family
More than a reverie
You were a friend to me
Sometimes I cry out for my Joan of Arc
To come back and lead the march
Gone is my Matriarch
