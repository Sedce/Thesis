[verse]
Rise now, awaken from your slumber
The spell that you?re under
Is melting away now
Sunset is breakin? through your window

And making a shadow
The ghost of a long day
Goes driftin? by
It?s so late and now it?s time to
[chorus]
Rise
You?re runnin? out of daylight
Stare into the sunlight
Stand and face the cold night

You can rise
And while the world is sleeping
The light is in your keeping
Open up your eyes
Rise
[verse]
Nightmares have gone
And left you haunted
You got what you wanted
You wanted to breathe
 

But somehow you crumbled under pressure
The pain of your pleasures
Has taken you way down
But now it?s time to lay down
Your broken mind and
[chorus]
Rise
You?re runnin? out of daylight
Stare into the sunlight
Stand and face the cold night

You can rise
And while the world is sleeping
The light is in your keeping
Open up your eyes
Rise

The ghost of a long day
Has passed you by
It?s so late and now it?s time to

Rise
You?re runnin? out of daylight
Stare into the sunlight
Open up your eyes
Rise
Open up your eyes, yeah
 

[Incomprehensible]
You?re runnin? out of daylight
