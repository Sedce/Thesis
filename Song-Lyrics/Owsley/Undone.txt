[verse]
You took me outta circulation
Well fate would agreed with the likes of me
And handed me a sweet salvation
Angel above come and set me free
[chorus]
I never knew that I'd find
Someone like you to blow my mind
I've seen everything under the sun
But it was you that made me come undone
I never dreamed of finding the one
But it was you that made me come undone
[verse]
Look at you in all your glory
Take care of the breath that you take away
Every picture tells a story
The shape of things words cannot say
[chorus]
I never knew that I'd find
Someone like you to blow my mind
I've seen everything under the sun
But it was you that made me come undone
I never dreamed of finding the one
But it was you that made me come undone
