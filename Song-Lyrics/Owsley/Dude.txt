[verse]
Turn it up
Tell me
You're the girl who never goes away again
Sell me
On how the fairytale could never end
Help me
Find a happy ever after
[chorus]
You, did something that you said you'd never do
Took my heart and broke it right in two
Why'd ya have to go and be so rude
Well, that's no way to treat a dude
Now is it now
[verse]
Spare me
All the rhetoric, I've heard it all before
Dare me
But I'm not game to try it anymore
Nearly
Went postal when I figured out that
[chorus]
You, did something that you said you'd never do
Took my heart and broke it right in two
Why'd ya have to go and be so rude
Well, that's no way to treat a dude
Now is it now
