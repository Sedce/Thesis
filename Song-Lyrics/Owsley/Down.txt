[verse]
Another bridge I have burned
A lesson I learned
One more mistake to my cause
One more hand got lost
In a game
So I was up for awhile
Livin' in style
Feelin' high on the hog
[bridge]
I was down

[chorus]
Now some say I lost
His other soul
How barely a young man
Can sink so low
And I don't know... don't care at all
[verse]
I had a similar dream
of my dreams while
I thought I had wandered a mile
I was wrong
[outro]
Now I'm on the way up
When you reach the top
no way to go
And people just don't wanna know
When you're down
