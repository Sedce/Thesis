Remember when you where a flower so tender
The day you arrived like a school girl
Wanting to learn everything
Your mother, the baroness, let you discover
The ways of the world so he showed you
And that's when he started to know you
I'm talkin' the biblical sense
***chorus***
Oh no, baby's such a dirty bird
(I know what you're really after yeah)
Oh no, baby's such a dirty bird
***
Fiction, the decadent life of addiction
Always the life of the party
And everyone figured Bacardi
But you were off cookin' the spoon
***chorus***
You always knew you were the one
To beat the band
Everyone knows you do
the very best you can
A Faithful Marianne
***chorus*
