[verse]

I wanna show you the rhythm and the roll
And take it into the center of my soul
I wanna run through the fields of your imagination

Under the blue skies, you're the golden sun
I look in your eyes and know you are the one
See where my heart lies, trippin' on the fascination

[chorus]
Along the way
I will hang on every single word you say
And should you whisper asking me to stay
Maybe I'll, lay a while to kiss your smile

I wanna know how it feels to believe in something
Ride on the heels of a good thing coming
Run to the one thing I know is something true
I wanna be with you, yeah

Want you to show me, the wonders of the world
Feel like you know me like no other girl
You have and hold me, leading me out of the darkest night

Into the light
Never has it ever felt so right
And from this moment on you are the sight
I can't erase, I close my eyes to see your face
 
[chorus]
I wanna know how it feels to believe in something
Ride on the heels of a good thing coming
Run to the one thing I know is something true

[verse]
I wanna live my life like I hold the meaning
Deep inside my soul I hear the music screaming
Eyes wide open, I'm awake and dreaming too

I wanna be with you
[chorus]
I wanna show you the rhythm and the roll
And take you into the center of my soul
I wanna run through the fields of your imagination

I wanna know how it feels to believe in something
Ride on the heels of a good thing coming
Run to the one thing I know is something true

I wanna live my life like I hold the meaning
Deep inside my soul I hear the music screaming
Eyes wide open I'm awake and dreamin' too
I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you
