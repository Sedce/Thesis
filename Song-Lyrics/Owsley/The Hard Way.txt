That woman must be 85
Holdin' on for dear life
To a plastic cup of change
Black kid in the bathroom
Sellin' cigarettes and perfume
To the hopeless and the strange
I stumble through the mezzanine
Neon lights and nicotine
The sound and smell of greed
One more day, one more week, one more loosing streak
But one more chance is all I need
It's always waiting for you
To save you or destroy you
***chorus***
Roll on
I've been trying to make this pay for
So long
Let me learn the hard way
Let me learn the hard way
***
Time don't exist in here
I'm counting out the hours
By every beer that comes around
I'm breathing in the oxygen
The call girls and the slot machines
And the roulette spinnin' round
Cause I can never hold I just go on until I fold
Until I'm battered broke and bruised
Anything I win
Well I just throw it all back in
Until there's nothing left to loose
It's always waiting for you
To save you or destroy you
***chorus***
She's always waiting for me
To love me or ignore me
***chorus***
