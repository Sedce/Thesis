I found him by the stage last night -- he was breathing his last breath
A bottle of wine and a cigarette was all that he had left
I can see you make music 'cause you carry a guitar
God help the troubadour who tries to be a star

So play the chords of love, my friend, play the chords of pain
If you want to keep your song
Don't, don't, don't, don't play the chords of fame

I seen my share of hustlers as they try to take the world
When they find their melody, they're surrounded by the girls
But it all fades so quickly like a sunny summer day
Reporters ask you questions, they write down what you say

So play the chords of love, my friend, play the chords of pain
If you want to keep your song
Don't, don't, don't, don't play the chords of fame

They'll rob you of your innocence, they will put you up for sale
The more that you will find success, the more that you will fail
I been around, I've had my share, and I really can't complain
But I wonder who I left behind the other side of fame

So play the chords of love, my friend, play the chords of pain
If you want to keep your song
Don't, don't, don't, don't play the chords of fame
