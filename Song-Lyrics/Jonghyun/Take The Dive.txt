The sound of my breath had stopped without knowing
That痴 when I discovered you
All of the coincidences fell into your ocean in the end
I will take the dive
This small bathtub feels deep today
Singing na na na na na
I知 thinking of you
Then I知 diving

take the dive
Take the dive (woo woo woo)
Take the dive (woo)

I知 dreaming with my eyes open
Breathing in your air

When my small world met yours
Then the waves arose
Just one laugh
Colors in my once colorless heart
I will take the dive
The strange tide feels deeper today
Singing na na na na na
I hesitated for a second
Then I知 diving

Take the dive
Take the dive (woo woo woo)
Take the dive (woo)

I知 dreaming with my eyes open
Breathing in your air

Would you take the dive
Would you take the dive
Would you take the dive

Let me loose in your ocean
So I can only be filled with you
I wanna know you
From your surface to the other side of the ocean, oh I
Take the dive
Take the dive (woo woo woo)
Take the dive (woo)
I知 dreaming with my eyes open
(oh I will take the dive)
Breathing in your air
