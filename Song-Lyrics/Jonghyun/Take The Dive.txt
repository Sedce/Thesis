[intro]
The sound of my breath had stopped without knowing
That痴 when I discovered you
All of the coincidences fell into your ocean in the end
I will take the dive
This small bathtub feels deep today
Singing na na na na na
I知 thinking of you
Then I知 diving
[chorus]
take the dive
Take the dive (woo woo woo)
Take the dive (woo)
[bridge]
I知 dreaming with my eyes open
Breathing in your air
[verse]
When my small world met yours
Then the waves arose
Just one laugh
Colors in my once colorless heart
I will take the dive
The strange tide feels deeper today
Singing na na na na na
I hesitated for a second
Then I知 diving
[chorus]
Take the dive
Take the dive (woo woo woo)
Take the dive (woo)
[bridge]
I知 dreaming with my eyes open
Breathing in your air
[chorus]
Would you take the dive
Would you take the dive
Would you take the dive
[verse]
Let me loose in your ocean
So I can only be filled with you
I wanna know you
From your surface to the other side of the ocean, oh I
[chorus]
Take the dive
Take the dive (woo woo woo)
Take the dive (woo)
[outro]
I知 dreaming with my eyes open
(oh I will take the dive)
Breathing in your air
