[intro]
(Two, three, go)
[verse]
The sluggishly walking form
Looks like it’s on a great mood
The hurriedly fleeting figure
Feels like it can’t be seen
Even if I try to tempt you by scattering
The piece of biscuit you like
it’s useless with your strong will
Where are you headed to?
In where my eyes follow you
I can see your moving small friend
Is he, by chance, your boyfriend? Are you dating too?
Am I the only one solo in this world?
[chorus]
Ah, cockroaches have lovers, too
But not me, not me, not me
Ah, this is so sad
Ah, cockroaches get to have peck kisses
But only I can’t, only I can’t, only I can’t
Ah, the tears
It’s really sad, really sad
[verse]
I can hear grumbling dying sounds
The vermin cockroaches that I wish
Would die, are continuously hatching eggs

One by one, my innocent love cells kept dying
I wanted to spray insecticides
As it would feel like defeat, I couldn’t do it
I saw the cockroach couple being lovey dovey
[chorus]
Ah, cockroaches have lovers, too
But not me, not me, not me
Ah, this is so sad
Ah, cockroaches get to have peck kisses
But only I can’t, only I can’t, only I can’t
Ah, the tears
It’s really sad, really sad
[outro]
Where is the one who’ll date me?
(There’s none, there won’t be)
Where is the one who’ll hold hands with me?
(Just once)
Where is the one who’ll have peck kisses with me?
(I’ll meet them, cheer up, you’ll meet them)
Where is the one who’ll have kisses with me?
