[verse]
Turn around for a moment since I can’t
I don’t want you to see this poor side of me
It’s useless now, I’m useless to you
I’m just a coldly forgotten memory throw it out

What’s the use of burning red hot
It’ll just become black ashes
We shined so much but now there’s no meaning
I’ll be good, I’ll be good
I forcefully hold onto you, I poorly beg
But you are expressionless
[chorus]
The memories just became a wall
I can’t see you
You already know, yeah
I can’t follow you as a wall
That can’t be helped, yeah
[verse]
If I put black smoke inside me
My heart will burn red
But my ashes will scatter so lightly
I know that I’m useless now
I’m just dusty baggage
I shout out and blame myself
But you have no answer
[chorus]
The memories just became a wall
I can’t see you
You already know, yeah
I can’t follow you as a wall
That can’t be helped, yeah
[verse]
1, 2, 3, 4
I don’t care when, come back any time
I’ll be here, I told you with concern
But this isn’t for you, there’s no way to turn around my hardened heart
I don’t care when, come back any time
You’ll burn me with a lighter
Just to look cool in front of others
But I don’t care, I don’t care when
[chorus]
The memories just became a wall
I can’t see you
You already know, yeah
I can’t follow you as a wall
That can’t be helped, yeah
