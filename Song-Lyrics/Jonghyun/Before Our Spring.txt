[intro]
Before spring comes
Before it gets warm
Shall we meet?
Before the day comes
When everyone else is asleep
Let’s met
[verse]
Actually, looking at you
Watching over you makes me happy
Just looking at you smiling
Just watching over you makes me feel at peace
[chorus]
I know this sounds foolish
But I’m afraid to go to you
Even if you don’t understand
It’s alright, it’s alright
Because there’s still a lot of time
Before spring will come
[verse]
Actually, I don’t want spring to come
Don’t want it to get warmer
Just looking at you smile from afar
Makes my heart ache
[chorus]
I know this sounds foolish
But I’m afraid to go to you
Even if you don’t understand
It’s alright, it’s alright
Because there’s still a lot of time
Before spring will come
[bridge]
They say spring will come faster than last year
But the cold and frozen winter is still here
Don’t worry about what to do
I’m alright, spring will come to me too
[outro]
I don’t want to go to you
I’m afraid I’m contagious
when I forget my tears and my sadness
When spring comes to me too
Then
