[verse]
My line of vision has fallen
Not because I lost you
But I know I can’t hold you even if
I miss you to death

Ever since we let go of each other’s hands
I have gone blind
Now I don’t care who it is
[chorus]
Someone please hold me, I’m exhausted from this world
Someone please wipe me, I’m drenched with tears
Someone please notice my struggles first
Please acknowledge the poor me
Please help me
[verse]
Even if your eyes coldly wraps around me
I already threw away my body
Now I don’t care whatever it is
[chorus]
Someone please hold me, I’m exhausted from this world
Someone please wipe me, I’m drenched with tears
Someone please notice my struggles first
Please acknowledge the poor me
Please help me
[bridge]
I can’t forgive myself
I can’t forgive you
I keep making myself cry
Wanting the you of the past
Just need to go a little more
Just one more step and it’s all over
Don’t foolishly hold on, just let me go
Now I don’t care whatever it is
[chorus
Someone please hold me, I’m exhausted from this world
Someone please wipe me, I’m drenched with tears
Someone please notice my struggles first
Please acknowledge the poor me
Please help me
