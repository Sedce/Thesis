I didn’t care if you played me or not
Whatever it was, I just liked you, hey
I used to pound the floor, hit the walls and go crazy before
But still, I liked that you were next to me

When I quietly close my eyes
It feels like you’re quietly next to me
Sadly, when my heart droops
Feels like you’ll pat my shoulders

I’m feeling sentimental, I’m feeling sentimental
Without you, my room is empty, I’m feeling sentimental
Feels like yesterday, you were laying
Only a few centimeters away from me
I’m feeling sentimental, in this room without you

When I see myself eating
when I see myself taking care of my body
I think, what’s the point?
But when I see you smiling, I’m shook
Maybe it’s just my mood

I know you’re over it
Am I even special? Do you remember me?

When I quietly close my eyes
It feels like you’re quietly next to me
Sadly, when my heart droops
Feels like you’ll pat my shoulders

I’m feeling sentimental, I’m feeling sentimental
Without you, my room is empty, I’m feeling sentimental
Feels like yesterday, you were laying
Only a few centimeters away from me
I’m feeling sentimental, in this room without you

I haven’t really changed either
I’m sure you’re still the same too
It’s not like I wanna go back
Not like I miss you but

I’m feeling sentimental, I’m feeling sentimental
Without you, my room is empty, I’m feeling sentimental
Feels like yesterday, you were laying
Only a few centimeters away from me
I’m feeling sentimental, in this room without you
