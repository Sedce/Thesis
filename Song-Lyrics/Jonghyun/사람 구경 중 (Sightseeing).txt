Where are they going? Why are they so busy?
Feels like their souls have been sucked out
Their heads are down low
On their phones (eyes fixed)

Hey look up, it’s dangerous
All those people gathering around the bus station
It’s so gross, like a frowning cat’s face

Where is everyone going? Where is their destination?
I’m curious, where are you going?
They look miserable, like they’re being dragged
Their faces, their legs look so heavy babe

whoa (whoa) look at him (look at him)
Where’s he going (where’s he going) take me with you
whoa (whoa) look at him (look at him)
Where’re you going (where’re you going) take me with you

Whoa doo loo doo doo doo
Doo loo doo doo doo take me with you
Whoa doo loo doo doo doo
Doo loo doo doo doo take me with you

That lady over there is so busy
She’s not gonna look at me
The moment her eyes turn (hey hey)

Hey look up, it’s dangerous
All those people gathering around the bus station
It’s so gross, like a frowning cat’s face

Where is everyone going? Where is their destination?
I’m curious, where are you going?
They look miserable, like they’re being dragged
Their faces, their legs look so heavy

whoa (whoa) look at him (look at him)
Where’s he going (where’s he going) take me with you
whoa (whoa) look at him (look at him)
Where’re you going (where’re you going) take me with you

Whoa doo loo doo doo doo
Doo loo doo doo doo take me with you
Whoa doo loo doo doo doo
Doo loo doo doo doo take me with you
Whoa whoa whoa whoa

whoa (whoa) look at him (look at him)
Where’s he going (where’s he going) take me with you
whoa (whoa) look at him (look at him)
Where’re you going (where’re you going) take me with you

Whoa doo loo doo doo doo
Doo loo doo doo doo take me with you
Whoa doo loo doo doo doo
Doo loo doo doo doo take me with you
