[intro]
Eat a waffle
There’s four crosses in it, so you must believe it
[verse]
Yes #hashtag
Put his name in it and while you stay in bed
(search search)
It’s there, growing all around the room
They’re dating but I don’t really care
People are going crazy
[bridge]
I’m just here and they give me something to rip apart, thanks I guess
Once that wears out, just switch to a different story I guess

I was bored so this is good, so what happened?
[chorus]
Eat a waffle, you try it too, try eating the bad comments
They’re dating
That’s what they say
My friend’s cousin’s senior’s friend’s in-laws saw
That’s what they say
Those two fought
That’s what they say
They flipped the place over, turned it inside out and it was crazy
Never mind if it’s not true
[verse]
They’re pros, they’re pros
Talking about other people
They say his personality is shit, he seems like that
Nah, nothing special, I just don’t like his attitude
His eyes, the way he puts his hands in his pocket, don’t like any of it
[bridge]
I’m just here and they give me something to rip apart, thanks I guess
Once that wears out, just switch to a different story I guess

Such a powerful fortune tell you are, you know just by looking at his eyes
[chorus]
Eat a waffle, you try it too, try eating the bad comments

My friend’s cousin’s senior’s friend’s in-laws saw
That’s what they say

That’s what they say
They flipped the place over, turned it inside out and it was crazy
Never mind if it’s not true
[verse]
Hey, are you allowed to just say that?
Who cares? Who says I can’t?
Yea (why should I care about him?)
Yea (why should I defend him?)
I’m sure he’ll do fine
[chorus]
Eat a waffle
Four crosses on it, have faith
