Every time you open your eyes, it’s more clear.
What you dare not imagine
Absolute thing that can not be aimed
You’re always right and I’m wrong
The fingertip facing me
I’m still afraid.
I know it’s full
I understand it because it is you too oh
Two eyes clear reason
Reasons why the bottom of the ear lobe was hot
Mood at one’s fingertips
I’m the only one who can afford you.
Only one you need (need)
Only one you need (need)
The only one you need (need)
I’m trying to please you right here
I just gotta blow oh
You and I are missing that piece
I wanna be the only one
The only one you need
It’s always beautiful.
It seems to collapse.
It soon shines like an explosion.
The more uneasy the more
Even if the whole body is torn and scattered
I will not cover everything.
I got you here, I blew you.
It’s okay.
Two eyes clear reason
Reasons why the bottom of the ear lobe was hot
Mood at one’s fingertips
I’m the only one who can afford you.
Only one you need (need)
Only one you need (need)
You and I are missing that piece
I wanna be the only one
The only one you need
I can not wait for you
Disturbed form looks dangerous yeah
Yeah, relax, let me do it.
I can not just look at you like me.
I wanna be
I wanna be the only one
The only one you need yeah
You and I, a piece that I disappeared (I wanna be)
I wanna be the only one
The only one you need
Only one you need (need)
The only one you need
That piece that vanished
I wanna be the only one you need
