[chorus]
What would it feel like?
If I met eyes with you?
What would it feel like?
If I held hands with you?
What would it feel like?
If I kissed your lips?
I’m so curious (curious curious yeah yeah)
[verse]
I’m looking at your eyes, they shine so black
Don’t move, I wanna place you completely in my head
I don’t wanna be bland
I wanna hold your hand

The back of your neck, your ant waist
I wanna see everything from up close
I’m getting greedy
I wanna see everything closely
I wanna get to know you

When I meet eyes with you
When your hands brush against mine
I get sad because I wish for one more second
Put your skin on me, don’t take it away
[bridge]
I’m curious about all of you
I guess you’re not baby, am I the only one?
[chorus]
What would it feel like?
If I met eyes with you?
What would it feel like?
If I held hands with you?
What would it feel like?
If I kissed your lips?
I’m so curious (curious curious yeah yeah)
[verse]
Don’t get away from me, don’t go far away
I’m like a puppy left alone
I’m trembling, I don’t know what to do
Isn’t it sad?

Take care of me baby care about me
It’s always me like this, you’re always so relaxed baby
I’m looking at you but your legs are so pretty
(I can’t snap out of it)

When I meet eyes with you
When your hands brush against mine
I get sad because I wish for one more second
Put your skin on me, don’t take it away
[bridge]
I’m curious about all of you
I guess you’re not baby, am I the only one?
[chorus]
What would it feel like?
If I met eyes with you?
What would it feel like?
If I held hands with you?
What would it feel like?
If I kissed your lips?
I’m so curious (curious curious yeah yeah)
[verse]
I’m sure it’s awkward, I feel it too (still)
Don’t back away, don’t run away
Put your feet on my feet
Your hands on my waist, put them there
(Woo woo) stay chill baby
Relax lady
Feel this vibe, trust me (babe)
[outro]
What would it feel like?
If I met eyes with you?
What would it feel like?
If I held hands with you?
What would it feel like?
If I kissed your lips?
I’m so curious (curious curious yeah yeah)

What would it feel like?
What would it feel like?
What would it feel like?
What would it feel like?
What would it feel like?
(Curious curious)
