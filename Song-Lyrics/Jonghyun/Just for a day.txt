[intro]
Just for a day oh
Just for a day oh oh oh oh
[verse]
Don’t do this, you keep appearing
It’s over, it’s all in the past
I open my eyes, I close them
But even in my dreams, it’s you
[bridge]
Even if I can’t ever forget you
Even when yesterday becomes tomorrow
[chorus]
Just for a day oh
Just for a day oh oh oh oh
Just for a day, please
I wish you were dead
Just for a day, oh just for a day
[verse]
I’m not in your today anyway
You know that I can’t go on for a single day
Even when I’m drunk and swaying and want to lean, I can’t
[bridge]
Even if you can’t ever see me again
Even when tomorrow becomes yesterday
[chorus]
Just for a day oh
Just for a day oh oh oh oh
Just for a day, please
I wish I came back to life in your day
Just for a day, oh just for a day

Just for a day
[bridge]
Even if we can’t ever meet again
Even if we have different tomorrows
[chorus]
Just for a day oh
Just for a day oh oh oh oh
Just for a day, please
I wish we were together
Just for a day, oh just for a day
[outro]
Hey ey, just for a day
Just for a day, please, in this day
I wish we were together
Just for a day, oh just for a day
