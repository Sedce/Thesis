Black grease
It won’t come off, it’s like you
It’s on your white shirt
All over
It even feels dirty (dirty)
Yea it’s like you
Disgustingly spread out
Meeting eyes with you was my fault
It’s my fault that I didn’t know about myself

i want to clean it up (clean it up)
I want to fix it up (fix it up)
Let’s say this never happened
Let’s say this never happened

Throwing away my memories
Throwing away everything you gave me
Because it’s already been long since it lost meaning
Now go away, cuz I wanna erase you, go away

Throwing away my memories
Throwing away everything you gave me
Because it’s already been long since it lost meaning
Now go away, cuz I wanna erase you, go away

I did nothing wrong
If I had to choose, it’s that I got to know you
I was crazy, I tried to make things right
But what’s so good about you?
What do I have to lose?
After I met you, I only regret
If I had the chance to erase it all
I wish I could beg the kids who know you
So I don’t have to know you anymore
Crazy, crazy, I was crazy
I want to turn it all back

i want to clean it up (clean it up)
I want to fix it up (fix it up)
Let’s say this never happened
Let’s say this never happened

Throwing away my memories
Throwing away everything you gave me
Because it’s already been long since it lost meaning
Now go away, cuz I wanna erase you, go away

Throwing away my memories
Throwing away everything you gave me
Because it’s already been long since it lost meaning
Now go away, cuz I wanna erase you, go away

I know I know I know
I know I know I know
I don’t need the memories you gave me
It’s been a while since even the attachment went away
Gotta be alone better be alone

Throwing away my memories
Throwing away everything you gave me
Because it’s already been long since it lost meaning
Now go away, cuz I wanna erase you, go away

Throwing away my memories
Throwing away everything you gave me
Because it’s already been long since it lost meaning
Now go away, cuz I wanna erase you, go away
