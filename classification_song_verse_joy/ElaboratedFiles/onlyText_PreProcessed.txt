the clouds that gathered turned to rain the candles on your sill burned out the weather on your face turned to match the mood outside reading through poems that you saved that make the gloomy hours make sense or do they lose their power with the yellowing of age i wish that i could find a seed and plant a tree that grows so high so that i could climb and harvest the ripe stars for you and i to drink and spit the ashes from our mouths and put the grey back in the clouds and send them packing with our bags of old regrets and sorrows 'cause they do n't do a thing but drag us down so far down the past is like a braided rope each moment tightly coiled inside

with off season blooms one season flows endlessly into the next the joke plays out again just like it did on that day when ivy leaves unnoticed spread their roots the scene greeting me slipped away without a sound i aim for the distance beyond and kick old memories away not because they 're sad but they are n't happy either to gain wisdom a fleeting moment is never enough it was but an instant of clarity that flashed by me yesterday supposing a ripe fruit were to wither and fall unseen its sweetly intoxicating fragrance would still have adorned one season ivy will spread i will perish away and a fragment of memory will return to the ground perhaps to become a flower again like a merry-go-round & round let 's meet in the spring again it spins and spins and even the tears and the rain twinkling from fragments of distant memories will be swallowed into the sands ( 2 ) [ outr ] hurry go round even though you may shatter because it 's a fleeting instant before you fall without waiting for the right moment spin hurry merry-go-round even if life pulls you under let 's meet in the spring again let 's meet in the spring let 's meet in the spring

a gentle rain embraces you soon you will ascend into the sky the snow colored clouds take the pink color of cherry trees it takes you away under that endless sky in the cage that is called freedom
ignoring the captured butterfly 's desperate plea you glare at the sky i did n't hurt because i hated i did n't have wings and the sky was too high [ verse you should use my wings spider you do n't know the pain of endless flight and maybe you 'll realize one day that you were only flying in the palms of someone else and even dared to call that freedom . could n't fly with borrowed wings you fall straight down head first beyond that barely visible sky birds heading south let 's fly once again cutting down these threads this time with one 's own jet when that cloud passes ... pink spider the sky is calling pink spider pink spider
for example somewhere along your journey your engine goes idle because of that it 's all a waste right ? but a situation made of nothing can be turned into anything so you can go anywhere you want to no matter how many years we wait we 'll be having lots of fun out in space carry that missile in your heart and let 's soar

procession moves on the shouting is over praise to the glory of loved ones now gone talking aloud as they sit round their tables scattering flowers washed down by the rain stood by the gate at the foot of the garden watching them pass like clouds in the sky try to cry out in the heat of the moment possessed by a fury that burns from inside cry like a child though these years make me older with children my time is so wastefully spent a burden to keep though their inner communion accept like a curse an unlucky deal played by the gate at the foot of the garden my view stretches out from the fence to the wall no words could explain no actions determine just watching the trees and the leaves as they fall
so this is permanence love-shattered pride what once was innocence turned on its side a cloud hangs over me marks every move deep in the memory of what once was love oh how i realised how i wanted time put into perspective tried so hard to find just for one moment thought i 'd found my way destiny unfolded i watched it slip away excessive flash points beyond all reach solitary demands for all i 'd like to keep let 's take a ride out see what we can find a valueless collection of hopes and past desires i never realised the lengths i 'd have to go all the darkest corners of a sense i did n't know just for one moment i heard somebody call looked beyond the day in hand there 's nothing there at all now that i 've realised how it 's all gone wrong got ta find some therapy this treatment takes too long deep in the heart of where sympathy held sway got ta find my destiny before it gets too late
why do you stare ? do you think that i care ? you 've been misled by the thoughts in your head your words waste and decay nothing you say reaches my ears anyway you never spoke a word of truth why do you think i believe what you said ? few of your words ever enter my head i 'm tired of hypocrite freaks with tongues in their cheeks turning their eyes as they speak they make me sick and tired i ruled all of the earth witnessed my birth cried at the sight of a man and still i do n't know who i am i 've seen paupers as kings puppets on strings dance for the children who stare you must 've seen them everywhere

during the middle of the dark night i 'm just standing . i ca n't even see in front of me to where i should go where would it be even if i look around me it 's no use . in the river waters that is life endlessly as i float around like the floating plants ( another translation is mulch ; basically the plant matter floating on the water surface ) and when i touch some peaceful lake shore i will probably rot with the water . between the endless words me and you are getting weary with another kind of action with another kind of word we console ourselves the more acknowledgement the novelty gets further and further away just going back and forth like a pendulum

we all know this worlds ' going through some big changes it gets to the point where all phenomenon seem crazy people start looking for ways to live outside from the system that makes them all so blind some try to find new fields to explore from outside their heads some go in there and find that the richness of life is so easy to multiply just by throwing away all the thoughts that keep us from learning to know the personality that lives inside us and tries to come out but facing it is the key to unwind from closing yourself as the surroundings provide one day we will say goodbye to all of them who live the time no more need to compromise no more questions : tell me why this balanced heart needs no disguise but shamen seeds for all mankind the shamen seeds for all mankind

everyone 's a liar and i think i 'm burning out it seems like life just ends the same way it begins so many die with nothing and so few ever win . and you can tell me what you want you can scream or even cry but if it passes through your leps i 'm gon na know that it 's a lie . suppression creates depression so let your thought flow free just open up your mind and i promise you will see . stay within the lines stel your spine make up your mind you 're just like all the rest and you 're wating my time .

in those streets i stumble over cracked concrete running in circles on tired feet . i 'm sick of all this hatred it does no one no good if i could change the world you fucking bet i would . we are the new school its up to us to change the way things are to make things better . fuck separatism we have to unite at all costs . unconditional acceptance of people into our lives and scenes is the only way . race age sex religion what you wear what music you like who you fuck ... none of it matters . the adult society infested with snobbery and violence should bear no reflection on our underground . instead of turning our backs to the new kids wanting to learn about our scenes we should teach them how it should be .
living a life governed by pain i step away from the fire but i carry the flame . my youth i 'm proud i wear it on my sleeve my faceless generation 's gon na make you see . remember the times of harmony and how i want them back wait until the time is right and then we will attack pride honor i wear it on my sleeve my faithless generation 's gon na make you see . watch it all fall down around you while you sit safe at home we 're packing up and moving on and you 'll be left alone . the carefree world that used to be has fallen out of sight i want to take it back but it 's going to be a fight .

i do n\u0092t like my mind right now stacking up problems that are so unnecessary wish that i could slow things down i wan na let go but there \u0092s comfort in the panic and i drive myself crazy thinking everything 's about me yeah i drive myself crazy 'cause i ca n\u0092t escape the gravity you say that i 'm paranoid but i \u0092m pretty sure the world is out to get me it \u0092s not like i make the choice to let my mind stay so fucking messy i know i 'm not the center of the universe but you keep spinning ' round me just the same i know i 'm not the center of the universe but you keep spinning ' round me just the same
