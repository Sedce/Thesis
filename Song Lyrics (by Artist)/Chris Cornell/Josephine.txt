Josephine where can you be now?
Again the sun is rising on my troubled heart
Don’t deny you know you and I
Are the making of what fate
Just can’t pull apart

My sweet Josephine
Won’t you come and marry me?
I got every kind of love that you would ever need
Dying here on bended knees

Sheets of rain
Cold and gray
Run down the page
Just about your name
With just the weight of your silent smile
Crashing all around me while i screamed it out loud

My sweet Josephine
Won’t you come and marry me?
I got every kind of love that you would ever need
Dying here on bended knees

Like a raven in a cage
Blood on my birth
Just won’t wash away
Like a stitched together doll
My feet to the flame
As I follow the blame
For someone else’s pain
For someone else’s pain

Rivers of black ink flood
A tapestry of flesh and blood around my frame
A living shrine just for you of human mind
Golden pen upon your hand
Leave this endless winter behind

My sweet josephine
Won’t you come and marry me?
I got every single kind of love that you would ever need
Dying here on bended knees
Dying here on bended knees
Dying here on bended knees
My Josephine
