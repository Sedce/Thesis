during the middle of the dark night i'm just standing.
i can't even see in front of me
to where i should go, where would it be
even if i look around me, it's no use.
in the river waters that is life, endlessly
as i float around like the floating plants (another translation is "mulch"; basically the plant matter floating on the water surface)
and when i touch some peaceful lake shore
i will probably rot with the water.


stand up, stand up
we're going to try again once more
stand up, stand up
like spring's new sprouts


between the endless words
me and you are getting weary
with another kind of action, with another kind of word
we console ourselves
the more acknowledgement, the novelty
gets further and further away
just going back and forth like a pendulum

it will probably falter (this verb can also mean "shake") every day

stand up, stand up
we're going to try once more
stand up, stand up
like spring's new sprouts

living life lightly is eventually
binding yourself up
even if the world ignores me, i will have to
live, be living
as beautiful as the flower is, it wilts all the more faster
even the dew drops that used to be clear when the sunlight shone on it
it dries up in a moment


stand up, stand up
we're going to try once more
stand up, stand up
like spring's new sprouts
stand up, stand up
we're going to try once more
stand up stand up
like spring's new sprouts
