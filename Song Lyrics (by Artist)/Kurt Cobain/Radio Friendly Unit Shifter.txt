Use just once and destroy
Invasion of our piracy
Afterbirth of a nation
Starved without your skeleton key
I love you for what I am not
I did not want what I have got
Blanket acne'd with cigarette burns
Speak at once while taking turns
What is wrong with me? 
What is wrong with me? 
What is wrong with me?
I'm gonna do with what you think
If you ever think at all
Bi-polar opposites attract
All of a sudden my water broke
I love you for what I am not
I did not want what I have got
Blanket acne'd with cigarette burns
Second-rate third degree burns
What is wrong with me? 
What is wrong with me? 
What do I think? I think
Hate your enemies
Save, save your friends
Find, find your place
Speak, speak the truth
What is wrong with me? 
What is wrong with me? 
What is what I need? 
What do I think? I think
Just use once and destroy
Invasion of our piracy
Afterbirth of a nation
Starved without your skeleton key
What is wrong with me? 
What is wrong with me? 
What is wrong with me? 
What do I think? I think
What is wrong with me? 
What is wrong with me? 
What is wrong with me? 
What do I think? I think
