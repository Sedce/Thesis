If I ever leave you baby... you can say I told you so
And if I ever hurt you... you know I hurt myself as well

Is that anyway for a man to carry on
Do you think I want my loved one gone
Said I love you 
More than you'll ever know
More than you'll ever know

When I wasn't making much money
You know where my paycheck went
You know I brought it home to ya baby
And I never spent a red cent yeahhhh

Is that any way for a man to carry on
Do you think I want my loved one gone
Said I love you
More than you'll ever know
Heyyah
More than you'll ever know

I'm not trying to be
just any kind of man... no I ain't
I'm just trying to be somebody
You can love, trust and understand
I know I know I know that I can be 
A part of you that no one else could see... yeah

But I got to hear you say, 
I got hear ya say
its alright 

I'm only flesh and blood
But I could be anything that you demand
I can be king of everything or just a tiny grain of sand

Now tell me
Is that anyway for a man to carry on
Do you think that I want my loved one gone
I love you... more than you'll ever know
I said I love you I love ya I love you 
Heyyah don't want nobody else I don't need nobody else
