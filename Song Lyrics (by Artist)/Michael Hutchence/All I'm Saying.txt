You put your heart
With trust into my hands
I held so tight
Kept you protected from things
Did you ever think about it?
Did you ever cry about it?
Would you ever, ever doubt it?
All I'm saying is come around
Tell me 'bout the life you found
I put my heart
With trust into your hands
One day, comes change
Some pain and rain comes falling down
Did you ever think about it?
(Don't say it)
Did you ever lie about it?
(Don't say it)
Could you ever live without it?
All I'm saying is come around
Tell me 'bout the life you found
(Tell me 'bout the life you found)
We search endlessly
For answers to war and pain
We love the nights
Some days we laugh, feel like it's alright
Did you ever think about it?
(Don't say it)
Did you ever cry about it?
(Don't say it)
Could you ever live without it?
All I'm saying is come around
Tell me 'bout the one you found
All I'm saying is come around
Tell me 'bout the one you found
