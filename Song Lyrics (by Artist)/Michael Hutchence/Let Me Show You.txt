This shattered town gets me down
My ticket's booked then you were found
I tore them up like you tore my heart
I'm black and blue from love and art
Who could take it?
(Give it up, gimme)
I guess I'll shake it, but
No-one touches all you are
Strip to show me all you are
Let me show you how you make me feel
(I've got my finger on the trigger)
Well through the twilight how I've tried
To get my thoughts deep in your mind
In my sleep I've tasted you
Intoxicated by your every move
Who could take it?
(Give it up, gimme)
I guess I'll shake it, but
No-one touches all you are
Strip to show me all you are
Let me show you how you make me feel
(I've got my finger on the trigger)
