I'm not keeping time, get me outta here
Folding up my crimes, ready for what's said to me
Does all that glitters shine? Love that new attraction
Animal inside, leads me to the conclusion
Don't save me from myself
Don't save me from myself
I listen to the wind, and mystery comes alive
Don't tie me up again, separate love from possession
Does all that glitters shine? Love that new attraction
Animal inside, leads me to the conclusion, ugh!
Don't save me from myself, yeah
Don't save me from myself
Don't save me from myself da da da dey
Oh, separate love from all possession
Don't save me from myself
Don't save me from myself
Don't save me from myself
Don't save me from myself
Don't save me from myself
Don't save me from myself
Don't save me from myself
Don't save me from myself
Don't save me from myself
Don't save me from myself
Don't save me from myself
