Trip away the bones and skin, looking for what lies within
See the stars so cold above
Makes no sense of your flesh and blood
You walked the longest walk, talked the toughest talk
You were outside, something inside
Took away the words, you want to hear again
You were outside, something inside
All of the days we thought would come
All of the words we thought had gone
All of the pain and pleasure gone without you
Strip away the bones and skin, show me what lies within
Would you be the one that I love?
Make no sense of your flesh and blood
You walked the longest walk, talked the toughest talk
You were outside, something inside
Took away the words, you want to live again
You were outside, something inside
All of the days we thought would come
All of the words we thought had gone
All of the pain and pleasure gone without you
All of the days we thought would come
All of the words we thought had gone (on and on)
All of the pain and pleasure gone (pleasure gone) without you
We'd be making love, make it right (right, right)
All of the days we thought would come
All of the words we thought had gone (on and on)
All of the pain and pleasure gone without you
All of the days we thought would come (thought would come)
All of the words we thought had gone (on and on)
All of the pain and pleasure gone (pleasure gone) without you
(Thought would come, on and on, pleasure gone)
(All of the days we thought would come) (thought would come)
(All of the words we thought had gone) (on and on)
(All of the pain and pleasure gone) (pleasure gone) (without you)
