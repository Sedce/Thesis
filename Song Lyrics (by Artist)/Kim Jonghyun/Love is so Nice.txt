Baby, when I’m with you,
I don’t care if we do nothing
So comfortable, I fall over with
laughter over nothing
I don’t even know how my days are passing
The moment I open my eyes,
to when I close them, I’m filled with you
(In my dark room, your white legs)
Stretch them out baby, get comfortable baby
(In my dark room, your white legs)
When I hold you in my arms (Woo) then I know

Love is so nice love is so nice
(My heart, my heart) It’s so amazing
Love is so nice (Love is so nice)
Love is so nice
Oh nice (Oh nice) No no no no

Wherever I go, whoever I meet, in the end,
I’m on my way to see you
Whoever you’re with, whether you’ve stopped,
I’m not nervous
When I look into your eyes,
there’s nothing to worry about
You know baby, we feel the same way baby, ooh

(In my dark room (Oh babe)
your white legs)
Stretch them out baby, (Oh yeah)
get comfortable baby
(In my dark room (Oh yeah)
your white legs)
When I hold you in my arms (Woo) then I know

Love is so nice love is so nice
(My heart, my heart) It’s so amazing
Love is so nice (Love is so nice)
Love is so nice
Oh nice (Oh nice) No no no no

One step, two steps, come to me
Only tell me baby
Nanana nanana nanana
Make me hum

Love is so nice love is so nice
(My heart, my heart) It’s so amazing
Love is so nice (Love is so nice)
Love is so nice
Oh nice (Oh nice) No no no no

Baby stay with me (Oh na)
Baby stay with me (Lalalala)
Baby stay with me (Lala lalala lalala)
Baby stay with me (Ooh)
Baby stay with me (Ooh~)
Baby stay with me (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Baby stay with me (Baby, with me)
Baby stay with me (Mmm)
