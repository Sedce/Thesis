Be honest, be honest with me
Don’t hide it, please don’t hide it

As the elevator doors close
I look so pitiful
But still, it’s the reason I blink and breathe and live
Is this right for me? Or am I being chased down?

Hello, hello, say hello
Say hello to the haggardly me
Hello, hello, say hello

Be honest, be honest with me
Don’t hide it, please don’t hide it
Since when did you start crying?
Do you know what kind of face you’re making?
You

Hello, hello, say hello
Say hello to the haggardly me
Hello, hello, say hello

I know you know all the bad stories of the world
But you don’t know me even though we shared a breath our whole lives
You don’t know, don’t know

Be honest, you’re really lonely
Be honest, you know you can’t go on any longer
Since when were you alone?
It’s to the point where it’s awkward
To look into my own eyes in the mirror
I’m, I’m
