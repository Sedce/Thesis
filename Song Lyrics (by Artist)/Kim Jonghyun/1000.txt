1, 2, 3, another day quickly passes
1, 2, 3, tomorrow is already almost here
Pressing down on my shoulders, pinning down the shadows
I need a place to comfortably rest

You and I
Even if it wasn’t back then
You and I
We would’ve definitely met some time
A lot of time has passed
But things aren’t different from the beginning
It’s still the same, I’m a blessed person

Hug me, lean on my shoulder
Have strong trust in me
You know that saying
I know even though you don’t say it
That is very touching but
Please tell me even if you know

Time is so fast
I used to be so awkward but I changed
It’s so funny
I used to freak out about small mistakes
But the one who smiled and waited for me was you
I’m so lucky

You and I
Even if it wasn’t back then
You and I
We would’ve definitely met some time
A lot of time has passed
But things aren’t different from the beginning
It’s still the same, I’m a blessed person

Hug me, lean on my shoulder
Have strong trust in me
You know that saying
I know even though you don’t say it
That is very touching but
Please tell me even if you know

I always said I didn’t care about numbers or dates
Like birthdays or anniversaries
But today, anyone can see, it’s a day to celebrate
It’s true

Hug me, lean on my shoulder
Have strong trust in me
You know that saying
I know even though you don’t say it
That is very touching but
Tell me you believe in me
