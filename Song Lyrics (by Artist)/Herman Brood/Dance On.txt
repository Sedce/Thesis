When everything around you turns to shit
and all your friends have split
all your lovers have gone
from this - to a life of blissI don't deserve to die stinkin' like this
I don't deserve to die stinkin' like thisThough she's gone
I dance on
Though she's gone
I dance onWhen everything around you turns to shit
and all your friends have split
all your lovers have gone from this
to a life of bliss
